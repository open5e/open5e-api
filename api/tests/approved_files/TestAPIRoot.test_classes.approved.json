As they grow more experienced, members of this path often take on roles as leaders or in other integral positions.\n\n##### Roar of Defiance\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can announce your presence by unleashing a thunderous roar as part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage. Until the beginning of your next turn, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target you.\n  Until the rage ends, if a creature within 5 feet of you that heard your Roar of Defiance deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to bellow at them. Your attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. The damage you deal with this feature increases to 2d6 at 10th level. Once a creature takes damage from this feature, you can't use this feature on that creature again during this rage.\n\n##### Running Leap\nAt 3rd level, while you are raging, you can leap further. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap a number of feet equal to your Strength score. With a 10-foot running start, you can long jump a number of feet equal to twice your Strength score.\n\n##### Lion's Glory\nStarting at 6th level, when you enter your rage, you can choose a number of allies that can see you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Until the rage ends, when a chosen ally makes a melee weapon attack, the ally gains a bonus to the damage roll equal to the Rage Damage bonus you gain, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Resonant Bellow\nAt 10th level, your roars can pierce the fog of fear. As a bonus action, you can unleash a mighty roar, ending the frightened condition on yourself and each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you and who can hear you. Each creature that ceases to be frightened gains 1d12 + your Charisma modifier (minimum +1) temporary hit points for 1 hour. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Victorious Roar\nAt 14th level, you exult in your victories. When you hit with at least two attacks on the same turn, you can use a bonus action to unleash a victorious roar. One creature you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failure, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your barbarian level and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn't frightened.",

The way these aspects manifest is up to you and can include sprouting horns from your head, changing the color of your skin, growing fangs or a tail, or other small physical changes. Though infused with fiendish power, you aren't a fiend. While raging, you have resistance to fire damage, and the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes 1d6 extra fire damage. This damage increases to 2d6 at 10th level.\n\n#####Hell's Vengeance\nAt 6th level, you can use your hellfire to punish enemies. If an ally you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage while you are raging, you can use your reaction to surround the attacker with hellfire, dealing fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus to it.\n\n#####Hellfire Shield\nStarting at 10th level, when you enter your rage, you can surround yourself with flames. This effect works like the fire shield spell, except you are surrounded with a warm shield only and it ends when your rage ends. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n#####Devilish Essence\nAt 14th level, while raging, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and if you take damage from a spell, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to your barbarian level.",

Over time, members of other races who saw the need to protect and cherish the green places of the world joined and learned from them.

If you are already proficient in Stealth, you gain proficiency in another barbarian class skill of your choice.\n\n##### Mistwood Defender\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the Reckless Attack feature on ranged weapon attacks with thrown weapons, and, while you aren't within melee range of a hostile creature that isn't incapacitated, you can draw and throw a thrown weapon as a bonus action.\n  In addition, when you make a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon using Strength while raging, you can add your Rage Damage bonus to the damage you deal with the thrown weapon.\n\n##### From the Mist\nBeginning at 6th level, mist and fog don't hinder your vision. In addition, you can cast the misty step spell, and you can make one attack with a thrown weapon as part of the same bonus action immediately before or immediately after you cast the spell. You can cast this spell while raging. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Mist Dance\nStarting at 10th level, when you use the Attack action while raging, you can make one attack against each creature within 5 feet of you in place of one of your attacks. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### War Band's Passage\nStarting at 14th level, when you use your From the Mist feature to cast misty step, you can bring up to two willing creatures within 5 feet of you along with you, as long as each creature isn't carrying more than its carrying capacity.

The barbarians who follow this path often do so after surviving a dragon encounter or are raised in a culture that worships them. Dragons tend to have a mixed view of the barbarians who choose this path. Some dragons, in particular the metallic dragons, view such a transformation as a flattering act of admiration. Others may recognize or even fully embrace them as useful to their own ambitions. Still others view this path as embarrassing at best and insulting at worst, for what puny, two-legged creature can ever hope to come close to the natural ferocity of a dragon? When choosing this path, consider what experiences drove you to such a course. These experiences will help inform how you deal with the judgment of dragons you encounter in the world.\n\n##### Totem Dragon\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you choose which type of dragon you seek to emulate. You can speak and read Draconic, and you are resistant to the damage type of your chosen dragon.\n\n| Dragon | Damage Type | \n|---------------------|-------------| \n| Black or Copper | Acid | \n| Blue or Bronze | Lightning | \n| Brass, Gold, or Red | Fire | \n| Green | Poison | \n| Silver or White | Cold |\n\n##### Wyrm Teeth\nAt 3rd level, your jaws extend and become dragon-like when you enter your rage. While raging, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with your bite against one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. You are proficient with the bite. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier + damage of the type associated with your totem dragon equal to your proficiency bonus.\n\n##### Legendary Might\nStarting at 6th level, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature twice between long rests.\n\n##### Aspect of the Dragon\nAt 10th level, you take on additional draconic features while raging. When you enter your rage, choose one of the following aspects to manifest.\n\n***Dragon Heart.*** You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your barbarian level. Once you manifest this aspect, you must finish a short or long rest before you can manifest it again.\n\n***Dragon Hide.*** Scales sprout across your skin. Your Armor Class increases by 2.\n\n***Dragon Sight.*** Your senses become those of a dragon. You have blindsight out to a range of 60 feet.\n\n***Dragon Wings.*** You sprout a pair of wings that resemble those of your totem dragon. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless it is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\n\n##### Wyrm Lungs\nAt 14th level, while raging, you can use an action to make a breath weapon attack. You exhale your breath in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier), taking 12d8 damage of the type associated with your totem dragon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If you already have proficiency in one of these skills, your proficiency bonus is doubled for ability checks you make using that skill.\n\n##### Battle Fervor\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter a rage, you can expend one additional daily use of rage to allow a number of willing creatures equal to half your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you to enter a rage as well. A target must be able to see and hear you to enter this rage. Each target gains the benefits and restrictions of the barbarian Rage class feature. In addition, the rage ends early on a target if it can no longer see or hear you.\n\n##### Lorekeeper\nAs a historian, you know how much impact the past has on the present.

After you cast a spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Bolstering Chant\nAt 10th level, when you end your rage as a bonus action, you regain a number of hit points equal to your barbarian level *x* 3. Alternatively, if you end your rage and other creatures are also raging due to your Battle Fervor feature, you and each creature affected by your Battle Fervor regains a number of hit points equal to your barbarian level + your Charisma modifier.\n\n##### Thunderous Oratory\nAt 14th level, while you are raging, your attacks deal an extra 2d6 thunder damage. If a creature is raging due to your Battle Fervor feature, its weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 thunder damage. In addition, when you or a creature affected by your Battle Fervor scores a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone in addition to any extra damage from the critical hit.",

If you take damage before your first turn, you can enter a rage as a reaction, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from the triggering attack.\n  When you reach 8th level in this class, you get 1 extra reaction on each of your turns. This extra reaction can be used only for features granted by the Path of the Inner Eye, such as Insightful Dodge or Preemptive Parry. When you reach 18th level in this class, this increases to 2 extra reactions on each of your turns.\n\n##### Insightful Dodge\nBeginning at 6th level, when you are hit by an attack while raging, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet. If this movement takes you beyond the range of the attack, the attack misses instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Foretelling Tactics\nStarting at 10th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack while raging, up to two creatures of your choice who can see and hear you can each use a reaction to immediately move up to half its speed toward the creature you hit and make a single melee or ranged weapon attack against that creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Preemptive Parry\nAt 14th level, if you are raging and a creature you can see within your reach hits another creature with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the attack and use the lower of the two rolls.

When you are hit by a melee weapon attack by a creature within 5 feet of you while raging, that creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. When you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4.\n  Alternatively, while raging, you can use your reaction to disarm a creature that hits you with a melee weapon while within 5 feet of you by catching its weapon in your thorns instead of the attacker taking damage from your thorns. The attacker must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or drop the weapon it used to attack you. The weapon lands at its feet. The attacker must be wielding a weapon for you to use this reaction.\n\n##### Toxic Infusion\nStarting at 10th level, when you enter your rage or as a bonus action while raging, you can infuse your thorns with toxins for 1 minute. While your thorns are infused with toxins, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with an unarmed strike must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Thorn Barrage\nAt 14th level, you can use an action to shoot the thorns from your body while raging. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. \n \nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. \n \n### Unarmored Defense \n \nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. \n \n### Reckless Attack \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn. \n \n### Danger Sense \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. \n \nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. \n \n### Primal Path \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Fast Movement \n \nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor. \n \n### Feral Instinct \n \nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. \n \nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. \n \n### Brutal Critical \n \nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. \n \nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. \n \n### Relentless Rage \n \nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. \n \nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. \n \n### Persistent Rage \n \nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it. \n \n### Indomitable Might \n \nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total. \n \n### Primal Champion \n \nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.",

                    "desc": "In the caverns beneath the surface of the world, sound works differently. Your exposure to echoes has taught you about how sound changes as it moves and encounters obstacles. Inspired by the effect caves and tunnels have on sounds, you have learned to manipulate sound with your magic, curving it and altering it as it moves. You can silence the most violent explosions, you can make whispers seem to reverberate forever, and you can even change the sounds of music and words as they are created.\n\n##### Echolocation\nWhen you join the College of Echoes at 3rd level, you learn how to see with your ears as well as your eyes. As long as you can hear, you have blindsight out to a range of 10 feet, and you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deafen you. At 14th level, your blindsight is now out to a range of 15 feet, and you no longer have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that would deafen you.\n\n##### Alter Sound\n \nAt 3rd level, you can manipulate the sounds of your speech to mimic any sounds you've heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check.\n  In addition, you can manipulate some of the sounds around you. You can use your reaction to cause one of the following effects. \n\n***Enhance.*** You can increase the volume of a sound originating within 30 feet of you, doubling the range it can be heard and granting creatures in range of the sound advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the sound. In addition, when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you takes thunder damage, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and increase the thunder damage by an amount equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.\n\n***Dampen.*** You can decrease the volume of a sound originating within 30 feet of you, halving the range it can be heard and granting creatures in range of the sound disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the sound. In addition, when a friendly creature within 30 feet of you takes thunder damage, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and decrease the thunder damage by an amount equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.\n\n**Distort.** You can change 1 word or up to 2 notes within 30 feet of you to another word or other notes. You can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to change a number of words within 30 feet of you equal to 1 + the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die, or you can change a number of notes of a melody within 30 feet of you equal to 2 + double the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die. A creature that can hear the sound can notice it was altered by succeeding on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. At your GM's discretion, this effect can alter sounds that aren't words or melodies, such as altering the cries of a young animal to sound like the roars of an adult.\n\n***Disrupt.*** When a spellcaster casts a spell with verbal components within 30 feet of you, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to disrupt the sounds of the verbal components. The spellcaster must succeed on a concentration check (DC 8 + the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die) or the spell fails and has no effect. You can disrupt a spell only if it is of a spell level you can cast.\n\n##### Resounding Strikes\nStarting at 6th level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal thunder damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d6. The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal.\n\n##### Reverberating Strikes\nAt 14th level, your Bardic Inspiration infuses your allies' weapon attacks with sonic power. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made, and all of the damage from that attack becomes thunder damage. The target of the attack must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked prone.",

Some bards focus on a certain type of information, like epic poetry, love ballads, or bawdy drinking songs. Others, however, turn to the shadowy occupation of investigating crimes. These bards use their knack for gathering information to learn about criminals and vigilantes, their tactics, and their weaknesses. Some work with agents of the law to catch criminals, but shadier members of this college use their dark knowledge to emulate the malefactors they have studied for so long.\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nWhen you join the College of Investigation at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight skill and in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics, Deception, Investigation, Performance, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.\n\n##### Quick Read\nAt 3rd level, your knowledge of underhanded tactics allows you to gain insight into your foes' strategies. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to make a Wisdom (Insight) check against one creature you can see within 30 feet contested by the creature's Charisma (Deception) check. Add the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die to the result of your check. You have disadvantage on this check if the target is not a humanoid, and the check automatically fails against creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or lower. On a success, you gain one of the following benefits: \n* The target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you for 1 minute. \n* You have advantage on saving throws against the target's spells and magical effects for 1 minute. \n* You have advantage on attack rolls against the target for 1 minute.\n\n##### Bardic Instinct\nStarting at 6th level, you can extend your knowledge of criminal behavior to your companions. When a creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you is damaged by a hostile creature's attack, it can use its reaction to roll that die and reduce the damage by twice the number rolled. If this reduces the damage of the attack to 0, the creature you inspired can make one melee attack against its attacker as part of the same reaction.\n\n##### Hot Pursuit\nStarting at 14th level, when a creature fails a saving throw against one of your bard spells, you can designate it as your mark for 24 hours. You know the direction to your mark at all times unless it is within an antimagic field, it is protected by an effect that prevents scrying such as nondetection, or there is a barrier of lead at least 1 inch thick between you.\n  In addition, whenever your mark makes an attack roll, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to subtract the number rolled from the mark's attack roll. Alternatively, whenever you make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect from your mark, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to add the number rolled to your saving throw. You can choose to expend the Bardic Inspiration after the attack or saving throw is rolled but before the outcome is determined.",

Their primary medium is information and secrets, though they are known to slip a dagger between ribs when necessary. Masters of insight and manipulation, these bards use every tool at their disposal in pursuit of their goals, and they value knowledge above all else. The more buried a secret, the deeper they delve to uncover it. Knowledge is power; it can cement empires or topple dynasties.\n  College of Shadows bards undergo careful training before they're sent out into the world. Skilled in both music and manipulation, they're the perfect blend of charm and cunning. The tricks they learn in their tutelage make them ideal for the subtle work of coaxing out secrets, entrancing audiences, and dazzling the minds of their chosen targets.\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nWhen you join the College of Shadows at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Stealth and in two other skills of your choice.\n\n##### Mantle of Shadows\nStarting at 3rd level, while you are in dim light or darkness, you can use an action to twist the shadows around you for 1 minute or until your concentration ends. For the duration, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on each of your turns.\n\n##### Cunning Insight\nStarting at 6th level, you know exactly where to hit your enemies. You can use an action to focus on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. You can use this feature as a bonus action if you expend a Bardic Inspiration die. If you do, roll the die and subtract the number rolled from the target's saving throw roll. If the target fails the saving throw, choose one of the following: \n* You have advantage on your next attack roll against the target. \n* You know the target's damage vulnerabilities. \n* You know the target's damage resistances and damage immunities. \n* You know the target's condition immunities. \n* You see through any illusions obscuring or affecting the target for 1 minute.\n\n##### Shadowed Performance\nStarting at 14th level, you are a master at weaving stories and influencing the minds of your audience. If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to make or break a creature's reputation by relaying a tale to an audience through song, poetry, play, or other medium. At the end of the performance, choose a number of humanoids who witnessed the entire performance, up to a number equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a target suffers one of the following (your choice): \n* For 24 hours, the target believes the tale you told is true and will tell others the tale as if it were truth. \n* For 1 hour, the target believes *someone* nearby knows their darkest secret, and they have disadvantage on Charisma, Wisdom, and Intelligence ability checks and saving throws as they are distracted and overcome with paranoia. \n* The target becomes convinced that you (or one of your allies if you choose to sing the praises of another) are a fearsome opponent. For 1 minute, the target is frightened of you (or your ally), and you (or your ally) have advantage on attack rolls against the target. A *remove curse* or *greater restoration* spell ends this effect early. You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.",

These minstrels gain a devoted following and rarely lack for company. Some of their devotees go so far as to put themselves at the service of the bard they admire. Though members of the college can be found as traveling minstrels and adventuring troubadours, they gravitate to large urban areas where their silver tongues and mind-bending performances have the greatest influence. Devious rulers sometimes seek out members of the college as counsellors, but the rulers must be wary lest they become a mere pawn of their new aide.\n\n##### Entourage\nWhen you join the College of Sincerity at 3rd level, you gain the service of two commoners. Your entourage is considered charmed by you and travels with you to see to your mundane needs, such as making your meals and doing your laundry. If you are in an urban area, they act as your messengers and gofers. When you put on a performance, they speak your praises and rouse the crowd to applause. In exchange for their service, you must provide your entourage a place to live and pay the costs for them to share the same lifestyle as you.\n  Your entourage doesn't join combat or venture into obviously dangerous areas or situations. If you or your companions abuse or mistreat your entourage, they leave your service immediately. If this occurs, you can gain the service of a new entourage by traveling to a different urban area where you must perform at least 1 hour each day for one week.\n  You gain another commoner at 6th level, and a final one at 14th level. If you prefer, instead of gaining a new commoner at 6th level, one member of your entourage can become a guard. At 14th level, if you have a guard, it can become your choice of a spy or veteran, instead of taking on a new commoner. If one member of your entourage becomes a guard, spy, or veteran, that person accompanies you into dangerous situations, but they only use the Help action to aid you, unless you use a bonus action to direct them to take a specific action. At the GM's discretion, you can replace the guard with another humanoid of CR 1/8 or lower, the spy with another humanoid of CR 1 or lower, and the veteran with another humanoid of CR 3 or lower.\n\n##### Kind-Eyed Smile\nAlso at 3rd level, when you cast an enchantment spell, such as *charm person*, your target remains unaware of your attempt to affect its mind, regardless of the result of its saving throw. When the duration of an enchantment spell you cast ends, your target remains unaware that you enchanted it. If the description of the spell you cast states the creature is aware you influenced it with magic, it isn't aware you enchanted it unless it succeeds on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.\n\n##### Lingering Presence\nStarting at 6th level, if a creature fails a saving throw against an enchantment or illusion spell you cast, it has disadvantage on subsequent saving throws it makes to overcome the effects of your spell. For example, a creature affected by your *hold person* spell has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes at the end of each of its turns to end the paralyzed effect.\n\n##### Artist of Renown\nAt 14th level, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration die to cast an enchantment spell you don't know using one of your spell slots. When you do so, you must be able to meet all of the spell's requirements, and you must have an available spell slot of sufficient level.\n  You can't use your Font of Inspiration feature to regain Bardic Inspiration dice expended to cast spells with this feature after a short rest. Bardic Inspiration dice expended by this feature are regained only after you finish a long rest.",

Members of this college travel from war zone to combat site and interview the veterans of those engagements, trying to discern how the victors won the day and leveraging that information for their personal glory.\n\n##### Combat Tactician\nWhen you join the College of Tactics at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and one martial weapon of your choice. In addition, you can use Bardic Inspiration a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1) + your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest (or short rest if you have the Font of Inspiration feature), as normal.\n\n##### Setting the Board\nAlso at 3rd level, you can move your allies into more advantageous positions, just as a general moves troop markers on a map. As a bonus action, you can command up to three willing allies who can see or hear you to use a reaction to move. Each target can move up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Song of Strategy\nBeginning at 6th level, you can share your tactical knowledge with your allies in the heat of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that die and perform one of the following strategies. For the purpose of these strategies, \u201cyou\u201d refers to the creature with the Bardic Inspiration die.\n\n***Bait and Bleed.*** If you take the Dodge action, you can make one melee attack against a creature that is within 5 feet of you, adding the number rolled to your attack roll.\n\n***Counter Offensive.*** If you take damage from a creature, you can use your reaction to make one attack against your attacker, adding the number rolled to your attack roll. You can't use this strategy if the attacker is outside your weapon's normal range or reach.\n\n***Distraction.*** You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action, increasing your speed by 5 feet *x* the number rolled.\n\n***Frightening Charge.*** If you take the Dash action, you can make one melee attack at the end of the movement, adding the number rolled to your attack roll. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is frightened until the start of your next turn.\n\n***Hold Steady.*** If you take the Ready action and the trigger for the readied action doesn't occur, you can make one weapon or spell attack roll after all other creatures have acted in the round, adding the number rolled to the attack roll.\n\n***Indirect Approach.*** If you take the Help action to aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you, the friendly creature can add the number rolled to their attack roll against the target, and each other friendly creature within 5 feet of you has advantage on its first attack roll against the target.\n\n##### Ablative Inspiration\nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a spell or effect that affects an area, such as the *fireball* spell or a dragon's breath weapon, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration as a reaction to redirect and dissipate some of the spell's power. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your saving throw against the spell. If you succeed on the saving throw, each friendly creature within 10 feet of you is also treated as if it succeeded on the saving throw.",

The adventurous spirits who favor the College of the Cat let their curiosity and natural talents get them into impossible places. Most are skilled, cunning, and vicious enough to extricate themselves from even the most dangerous situations.\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nWhen you join the College of the Cat at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Acrobatics and Stealth skills and with thieves' tools if you don't already have them. In addition, if you're proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\n\n##### Inspired Pounce\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn to stalk unsuspecting foes engaged in combat with your allies. When an ally you can see uses one of your Bardic Inspiration dice on a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed and make one melee weapon attack against that creature. You gain a bonus on your attack roll equal to the result of the spent Bardic Inspiration die.\n  When you reach 6th level in this class, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and when you use Inspired Pounce, you can move up to your speed as part of the reaction.\n\n##### My Claws Are Sharp\nBeginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. In addition, when you use two-weapon fighting to make an attack as a bonus action, you can give a Bardic Inspiration die to a friendly creature within 60 feet of you as part of that same bonus action.\n\n##### Catlike Tread\nStarting at 14th level, while a creature has one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. When you have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.",

                    "desc": "Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. \n \nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic. \n \nThe college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority. \n \n##### Bonus Proficiencies \n \nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice. \n \n##### Cutting Words \n \nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed. \n \n##### Additional Magical Secrets \n \nAt 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against the number of bard spells you know. \n \n##### Peerless Skill \n \nStarting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.",

            "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nYou have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. \n \nYour spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *cure wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. \n \n### Bardic Inspiration \n \nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. \n \nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n \nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. \n \n### Jack of All Trades \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus. \n \n### Song of Rest \n \nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points. \n \nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. \n \n### Bard College \n \nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of \n \nthe class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level. \n \n### Expertise \n \nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. \n \nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Font of Inspiration \n \nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest. \n \n### Countercharm \n \nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required). \n \n### Magical Secrets \n \nBy 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. \n \nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table. \n \nYou learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level. \n \n### Superior Inspiration \n \nAt 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.",

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\n\n##### Deadly Stalker\nAt 17th level, you can use an action to describe or name a creature that is familiar to you or that you can see within 120 feet.

The tenets of deities who embody mercy promote ways to end bloody conflicts or deliver healing magics to those in need. While mercy for some may be benevolent, for others it is decidedly not so. More pragmatic mercy gods teach the best method to relieve the agony and torment brought on by monsters and the forces of evil is to bring about the end of that evil.\n **Mercy Domain Spells (table)**\n| Cleric Level | Spells                              | \n|--------------|-------------------------------------| \n| 1st          | *divine favor*, *healing word*      | \n| 3rd          | *aid*, *ray of enfeeblement*        | \n| 5th          | *bardo*, *revivify*                 | \n| 7th          | *death ward*, *sacrificial healing* | \n| 9th          | *antilife shell*, *raise dead*      |\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you take your place on the line between the two aspects of mercy: healing and killing. You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill and with the poisoner's kit. In addition, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and martial weapons.\n\n##### Threshold Guardian\nAlso at 1st level, when you hit a creature that doesn't have all of its hit points with a melee weapon attack, the weapon deals extra radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to half your proficiency bonus.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Involuntary Aid\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to wrest the lifeforce from an injured creature and use it to heal allies. As an action, you present your holy symbol to one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that doesn't have all of its hit points. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to three times your cleric level on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Then, one friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt to the target.\n\n##### Bolster the Living\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to manipulate a portion of the lifeforce that escapes a creature as it perishes. When a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to channel a portion of that energy into a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The friendly creature gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus until the end of its next turn.\n\n##### Divine Strike of Mercy\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the dual nature of mercy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) to the target. If the target dies from this attack, a friendly creature you can see within 5 feet of you regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. If no friendly creature is within 5 feet of you, you regain the hit points instead. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d6.\n\n##### Hand of Grace and Execution\nAt 17th level, you imbue the two sides of mercy into your spellcasting. Once on each of your turns, if you cast a spell that restores hit points to one creature or deals damage to one creature, you can add your proficiency bonus to the amount of hit points restored or damage dealt.",

Stepping through portals is a sacred prayer and woe betide any who seek to misuse them. Domain Spells You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Portal Domain Spells table. See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.\n\n**Portal Domain Spells**\n| Cleric Level | Spells                                    | \n|--------------|-------------------------------------------| \n| 1st          | *adjust position*, *expeditious retreat*  | \n| 3rd          | *glyph of shifting*, *misty step*         | \n| 5th          | *dimensional shove*, *portal jaunt*       | \n| 7th          | *dimension door*, *reposition*            | \n| 9th          | *pierce the veil*, *teleportation circle* |\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and either cartographer's tools or navigator's tools (your choice). In addition, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill.\n\n##### Portal Magic\nStarting at 1st level, you gain access to spells that connect places or manipulate the space between places. Each spell with \u201c(liminal)\u201d listed alongside its school is a cleric spell for you, even if it doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, and you can prepare it as you would any other spell on the cleric spell list. Liminal spells include *bardo*, *devouring darkness*, *door of the far traveler*, *ethereal stairs*, *hypnagogia*, *hypnic jerk*, *mind maze*, *mirror realm*, *pierce the veil*, *reciprocating portal*, *rive*, *subliminal aversion*, and *threshold slip*. See the Magic and Spells chapter for details on these spells.\n\n##### Portal Bond\nAt 1st level, you learn to forge a bond between yourself and another creature. At the end of a short or long rest, you can touch one willing creature, establishing a magical bond between you. While bonded to a creature, you know the direction to the creature, though not its exact location, as long as you are both on the same plane of existence. As an action, you can teleport the bonded creature to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or to the nearest unoccupied space, provided the bonded creature is willing and within a number of miles of you equal to your proficiency bonus. Alternatively, you can teleport yourself to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bonded creature.\n  Once you teleport a creature in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. You can have only one bonded creature at a time. If you bond yourself to a new creature, the bond on the previous creature ends. Otherwise, the bond lasts until you die or dismiss it as an action.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Dimensional Shift\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness the magic of portals and teleportation. As an action, you teleport a willing target you can see, other than yourself, to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you can see. When you reach 10th level in this class, you can teleport an unwilling target. An unwilling target that succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw is unaffected.\n\n##### Portal Touch\nAt 6th level, you can use a bonus action to create a small portal in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. This portal lasts for 1 minute, and it doesn't occupy the space where you create it. When you cast a spell with a range of touch, you can touch any creature within your reach or within 5 feet of the portal. While the portal is active, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the portal up to 30 feet. The portal must remain within 30 feet of you. If you or the portal are ever more than 30 feet apart, the portal fades. You can have only one portal active at a time. If you create another one, the previous portal fades.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Transpositional Divine Strike\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to imbue your weapon strikes with portal magic. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal damage to the target as normal, and you open a brief portal next to your target or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature takes 1d8 damage of your weapon's type as a duplicate of your weapon lashes out at the creature from the portal. When you reach 14th level, you can choose two creatures, creating a portal next to each and dealing 1d8 damage of your weapon's type to each. Alternatively, you can choose one creature and deal 2d8 damage to it.\n\n##### Portal Mastery\nAt 17th level, when you see a creature use a magical gateway, teleport, or cast a spell that would teleport itself or another creature, you can use your reaction to reroute the effect, changing the destination to be an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 100 feet of you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to use this feature again.",

You decide what your new form looks like, including height, weight, facial features, vocal tone, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. This feature works like the Change Appearance aspect of the *alter self* spell, except it lasts until you finish a short or long rest.\n  In addition, when you are reduced to less than half your hit point maximum, you can end this transformation as a reaction to regain hit points equal to 3 times your cleric level. Once you end the transformation in this way, you can't use this feature to change your appearance again until you finish a long rest.",

Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. \n \n##### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured. \n \nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct. \n \n##### Blessed Healer \n \nBeginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level. \n \n##### Divine Strike \n \nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. \n \n##### Supreme Healing \n \nStarting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you restore 12.",

                    "desc": "The Blood domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force within one\u2019s own physical body. The power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit\u2019s anchor within the mortal shell. The Gods of Blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one\u2019s own vitality, and even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of crimson. Almost any neutral or evil deity can claim some influence over the secrets of blood magic and this domain, while the gods who watch from more moral realms shun its use beyond extenuating circumstance./n When casting divine spells as a Blood Domain cleric, consider ways to occasionally flavor your descriptions to tailor the magic\u2019s effect on the opponent\u2019s blood and vitality. Hold person might involve locking a target\u2019s body into place from the blood stream out, preventing them from moving. Cure wounds may feature the controlling of blood like a needle and thread to close lacerations. Guardian of faith could be a floating, crimson spirit of dripping viscera who watches the vicinity with burning red eyes. Have fun with the themes!\n\n **Blood Domain Spells**\n | Cleric Level | Spells                                | \n |--------------|-------------------------------------------| \n | 1st          | *sleep*, *ray of sickness*                | \n | 3rd          | *ray of enfeeblement*, *crown of madness* | \n | 5th          | *haste*, *slow*                           | \n | 7th          | *blight*, *stoneskin*                     | \n | 9th          | *dominate person*, *hold monster*         |\n\n ##### Bonus Proficiencies\nAt 1st Level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.\n\n ##### Bloodletting Focus\nFrom 1st level, your divine magics draw the blood from inflicted wounds, worsening the agony of your nearby foes. When you use a spell of 1st level or higher to damage to any creatures that have blood, those creatures suffer additional necrotic damage equal to 2 + the spell\u2019s level.\n\n ##### Channel Divinity: Blood Puppet\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly control a creature\u2019s actions against their will. As an action, you target a Large or smaller creature that has blood within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or immediately move up to half of their movement in any direction of your choice and make a single weapon attack against a creature of your choice within range. Dead or unconscious creatures automatically fail their saving throw. At 8th level, you can target a Huge or smaller creature.\n\n ##### Channel Divinity: Crimson Bond\nStarting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to focus on a sample of blood from a creature that is at least 2 ounces, and that has been spilt no longer than a week ago. As an action, you can focus on the blood of the creature to form a bond and gain information about their current circumstances. You know their approximate distance and direction from you, as well as their general state of health, as long as they are within 10 miles of you. You can maintain Concentration on this bond for up to 1 hour.\nDuring your bond, you can spend an action to attempt to connect with the bonded creature\u2019s senses. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If they succeed, the connection is resisted, ending the bond. You suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Upon a failed saving throw, you can choose to either see through the eyes of or hear through their ears of the target for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). During this time, you are blind or deaf (respectively) with regard to your own senses. Once this connection ends, the Crimson Bond is lost.\n\n **Health State Examples**\n | 100%    | Untouched            | \n | 99%-50% | Injured              | \n | 49%-1%  | Heavily Wounded      | \n | 0%      | Unconscious or Dying | \n | \u2013       | Dead                 |\n\n ##### Sanguine Recall\nAt 8th level, you can sacrifice a portion of your own vitality to recover expended spell slots. As an action, you recover spell slots that have a combined level equal to or less than half of your cleric level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You immediately suffer 1d6 damage per spell slot level recovered. You can\u2019t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you\u2019re a 4th-level Cleric, you can recover up to two levels of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. You then suffer 2d6 damage.\n\n ##### Vascular Corruption Aura\nAt 17th level, you can emit a powerful aura as an action that extends 30 feet out from you that pulses necrotic energy through the veins of nearby foes, causing them to burst and bleed. For 1 minute, any enemy creatures with blood that begin their turn within the aura or enter it for the first time on their turn immediately suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Any enemy creature with blood that would regain hit points while within the aura only regains half of the intended number of hit points (rounded up).\nOnce you use this feature, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Many of these are the rulers of their respective pantheons, wielding the thunderbolt as a symbol of divine might. Most reside in the sky, but the domain also includes lords of the sea (like Donbettyr) and even the occasional chthonic fire deity (such as Pele). They can be benevolent (like Tlaloc), nourishing crops with life-giving rain; they can also be martial deities (such as Perun and Thor), splitting oaks with axes of lightning or battering their foes with thunderous hammers; and some (like Tiamat) are fearsome destroyers, spoken of only in whispers so as to avoid drawing their malevolent attention. Whatever their character, the awesome power of their wrath cannot be denied.\n\n**Storm Domain Spells (table)**\n\n| Cleric Level | Spells                               |\n|--------------|---------------------------------|\n| 1st          | fog cloud, thunderwave          |\n| 3rd          | gust of wind, shatter           |\n| 5th          | call lightning, sleet storm     |\n| 7th          | control water, ice storm        |\n| 9th          | destructive wave, insect plague |\n\n##### Bonus Proficiency\n\nWhen you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor as well as with martial weapons.\n\n##### Tempest\u2019s Rebuke\n\nAlso starting at 1st level, you can strike back at your adversaries with thunder and lightning. If a creature hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to target it with this ability. The creature must be within 5 feet of you, and you must be able to see it. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 damage on a failure. On a success, the creature takes only half damage. You may choose to deal either lightning or thunder damage with this ability.\n\nYou may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (at least once). When you finish a long rest, you regain your expended uses.\n\n##### Channel Divinity: Full Fury\n\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to increase the fury of your storm based attacks. Whenever you would deal lightning or thunder damage from an attack, rather than roll damage, you can use the Channel Divinity feature to deal the maximum possible damage.\n\n##### Storm Blast\n\nBeginning at 6th level, you can choose to push a Large or smaller creature up to 10 feet away from you any time you deal lightning damage to it.\n\n##### Divine Strike\n\nAt 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.\n\n##### Sky\u2019s Blessing\n\nStarting at 17th level, you gain a flying speed whenever you are outdoors. Your flying speed is equal to your present walking speed.",

            "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nAs a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four \n1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \n \n### Divine Domain \n \nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels. \n \n#### Domain Spells \n \nEach domain has a list of spells-its domain spells- that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. \n \n### Channel Divinity \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. \n \nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel \n \nDivinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. \n \n#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead \n \nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. \n \nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Destroy Undead \n \nStarting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. \n \n**Destroy Undead (table)** \n \n| Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR... | \n|--------------|--------------------------| \n| 5th          | 1/2 or lower             | \n| 8th          | 1 or lower               | \n| 11th         | 2 or lower               | \n| 14th         | 3 or lower               | \n| 17th         | 4 or lower               | \n \n### Divine Intervention \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. \n \nImploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. \n \nIf your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. \n \nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.",

                    "desc": "Druids of the Circle of Ash believe in the power of rebirth and resurrection, both physical and spiritual. The ash they take as their namesake is the result of burning and death, but it can fertilize the soil and help bring forth new life. For these druids, ash is the ultimate symbol of the elegant cycle of life and death that is the foundation of the natural world. Some such druids even use fresh ash to clean themselves, and the residue is often kept visible on their faces.\n  Druids of this circle often use the phoenix as their symbol, an elemental creature that dies and is reborn from its own ashes. These druids aspire to the same purity and believe resurrection is possible if they are faithful to their beliefs. Others of this circle are drawn to volcanos and find volcanic eruptions and their resulting ash clouds to be auspicious events.\n  All Circle of Ash druids request to be cremated after death, and their ashes are often given over to others of their order. What later happens with these ashes, none outside the circle know.\n\n##### Ash Cloud\nAt 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape and, rather than assuming a beast form, create a small, brief volcanic eruption beneath the ground, causing it to spew out an ash cloud. As an action, choose a point within 30 feet of you that you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n  This eruption creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of ash centered on the eruption point. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws until the start of its next turn. Creatures that don't need to breathe or that are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\n  You automatically succeed on this saving throw while within the area of your ash cloud, but you don't automatically succeed if you are in another Circle of Ash druid's ash cloud.\n  The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\n\n##### Firesight\nStarting at 2nd level, your vision can't be obscured by ash, fire, smoke, fog, or the cloud created by your Ash Cloud feature, but it can still be obscured by other effects, such as dim light, dense foliage, or rain. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against gas or cloud-based effects, such as from the *cloudkill* or *stinking cloud* spells, a gorgon's petrifying breath, or a kraken's ink cloud.\n#### Covered in Ash\nAt 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see (including yourself) takes damage, you can use your reaction to cover the creature in magical ash, giving it temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The target gains the temporary hit points before it takes the damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, while your Ash Cloud feature is active and you are within 30 feet of it, you can use a bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the cloud. You can use this teleportation no more than once per minute.\n\n##### Feed the Earth\nAt 10th level, your Ash Cloud feature becomes more potent. Instead of the normal eruption effect, when you first create the ash cloud, each creature within 10 feet of the point you chose must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n  In addition, when a creature enters this more potent ash cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws while it remains within the cloud. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe, but creatures that are immune to poison are immune to this effect.\n  If at least one creature takes damage from the ash cloud's eruption, you can use your reaction to siphon that destructive energy into the rapid growth of vegetation. The area within the cloud becomes difficult terrain that lasts while the cloud remains. You can't cause this growth in an area that can't accommodate natural plant growth, such as the deck of a ship or inside a building.\n  The ash cloud now lasts for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\n\n##### From the Ashes\nBeginning at 14th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, your body is consumed in a fiery explosion. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the explosion, your body becomes a pile of ashes.\n  At the end of your next turn, you reform from the ashes with all of your equipment and half your maximum hit points. You can choose whether or not you reform prone. If your ashes are moved before you reform, you reform in the space that contains the largest pile of your ashes or in the nearest unoccupied space. After you reform, you suffer one level of exhaustion.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

                    "desc": "Druids of the Circle of Bees are friends to all stinging insects but focus their attention on honeybees and other pollinating insects. When not adventuring, they tend hives, either created by the insects or by themselves. They tap into the horror inherent in stinging insects to protect their allies or the fields hosting their bee friends.\n\n##### Circle Spells\nYour bond with bees and other stinging beasts grants you knowledge of certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the true strike cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th levels, you gain access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle of Bees Spells table.\n  Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\n\n**Circle of Bee Spells**\n| Druid Level  | Spells                             | \n|--------------|------------------------------------| \n| 3rd          | *blur*, *bombardment of stings*    | \n| 5th          | *fly*, *haste*                     | \n| 7th          | *giant insect*, *locate creature*  | \n| 9th          | *insect plague*, *telepathic bond* |\n\n##### Bee Bond\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics or Stealth skill (your choice), and you can speak and understand Bee Dance, a language shared by bees that involves flying in dance-like patterns. Bees refuse to attack you, even with magical coercion.\n  When a beast other than a bee attacks you with a weapon that deals poison damage, such as a giant spider's bite or a scorpion's sting, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or have disadvantage on its attack rolls against you until the start of its next turn.\n\n##### Bee Stinger\nAlso at 2nd level, you can use an action and expend one use of your Wild Shape to grow a bee's stinger, typically growing from your wrist, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with an unarmed strike while this stinger is active, you use Wisdom instead of Strength for the attack, and your unarmed strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier + poison damage equal to half your proficiency bonus, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n  The stinger lasts for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down) or until you use your Wild Shape again.\n  When you reach 6th level in this class, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and the poison damage dealt by your stinger equals your proficiency bonus. In addition, the unarmed strike damage you deal while the stringer is active increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.\n\n##### Bumblebee Rush\nAt 6th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. When you do so, creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Hive Mind\nAt 10th level, when you cast *telepathic bond*, each creature in the link has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks if at least one creature in the link has proficiency in a skill that applies to that check. In addition, if one creature in the link succeeds on a Wisdom (Perception) check to notice a hidden creature or on a Wisdom (Insight) check, each creature in the link also succeeds on the check. Finally, when a linked creature makes an attack, it has advantage on the attack roll if another linked creature that can see it uses a reaction to assist it.\n\n##### Mantle of Bees\nAt 14th level, you can use an action to cover yourself in bees for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). While you are covered in a mantle of bees, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee weapon, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker takes 1d8 piercing damage and 1d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the attacker takes half the damage and isn't poisoned.\n  While the mantle is active, you can use an action to direct the bees to swarm a 10-foot-radius sphere within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 piercing damage and 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. The bees then disperse, and your mantle ends.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to create the mantle again.",

                    "desc": "Circle of Crystals druids first arose in subterranean environments, where they helped tend giant crystal gardens, but now they can be found most anywhere with access to underground caverns or geothermal activity. These druids view crystals as a naturally occurring form of order and perfection, and they value the crystals' slow growth cycle, as it reminds them the natural world moves gradually but eternally. This teaches young druids patience and assures elder druids their legacy will be carried on in each spire of crystal. As druids of this circle tend their crystals, they learn how to use the harmonic frequencies of different crystals to create a variety of effects, including storing magic.\n\n##### Resonant Crystal\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn to create a special crystal that can take on different harmonic frequencies and properties. It is a Tiny object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. As a bonus action, you can cause the crystal to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the light as a bonus action.\n  Whenever you finish a long rest, you can attune your crystal to one of the following harmonic frequencies. The crystal can have only one harmonic frequency at a time, and you gain the listed benefit while you are wearing or carrying the crystal. The crystal retains the chosen frequency until you finish a long rest. \n* **Clarity.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. \n* **Cleansing.** You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage. \n* **Focus.** You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain concentration on a spell when you take damage. \n* **Healing.** When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. \n* **Vitality.** Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using the resonant crystal as your focus, one creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you gains temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The temporary hit points last for 1 minute.\nTo create or replace a lost resonant crystal, you must perform a 1-hour ceremony. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous crystal, if one existed. If a previous crystal had a harmonic frequency, the new crystal has that frequency, unless you create the new crystal during a long rest.\n\n##### Crystalline Skin\nStarting at 6th level, when you take damage, you can use a reaction to cause your skin to become crystalline until the end of your next turn. While your skin is crystalline, you have resistance to cold damage, radiant damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, including to the triggering damage if it is of the appropriate type. You choose the exact color and appearance of the crystalline skin.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Magical Resonance\nAt 10th level, you can draw on stored magical energy in your resonant crystal to restore some of your spent magic. While wearing or carrying the crystal, you can use a bonus action to recover one expended spell slot of 3rd level or lower. If you do so, you can't benefit from the resonant crystal's harmonic frequency for 1 minute.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Crystalline Form\nAt 14th level, as a bonus action while wearing or carrying your resonant crystal, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to assume a crystalline form instead of transforming into a beast. You gain the following benefits while in this form: \n* You have resistance to cold damage, radiant damage, and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. \n* You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. \n* Your resonant crystal pulses with power, providing you with the benefits of all five harmonic frequencies. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose to activate only the Healing or Vitality harmonic frequencies or both. If you activate both, you can choose two different targets or the same target.\nThis feature lasts 1 minute, or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.",

                    "desc": "The Circle of Sand originally arose among the desert dunes, where druids forged an intimate connection with the sands that surrounded them. Now such circles gather anywhere with excess sand, including coastlines or badlands.\n  While the unacquainted might view sand as lifeless and desolate, druids of this circle know the truth\u2014there is life within the sand, as there is almost anywhere. These druids have witnessed the destructive power of sand and the sandstorm and know to fear and respect them. Underestimating the power of sand is only for the foolish.\n\n##### Sand Form\nWhen you join this circle at 2nd level, you learn to adopt a sandy form. You can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature and transform yourself into a form made of animated sand rather than transforming into a beast form. While in your sand form, you retain your game statistics. Because your body is mostly sand, you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to escape a grapple or the restrained condition.\n\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the equipment to move with you if you flow through particularly narrow spaces.\n\nYou can stay in your sand form for 10 minutes, or until you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again. While in your sand form, you can use a bonus action to do one of the following: \n* **Abrasive Blast.** You launch a blast of abrasive sand at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the creature takes slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier. \n* **Stinging Cloud.** You emit a cloud of fine sand at a creature you can see within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn.\n\nWhen you reach 10th level in this class, you can stay in your sand form for 1 hour or until you dismiss it. In addition, the damage of Abrasive Blast increases to 2d8, and the range of Stinging Cloud increases to 10 feet.\n\n##### Diffuse Form\nAlso at 2nd level, when you are hit by a weapon attack while in your Sand Form, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Sand Dervish\nStarting at 6th level, you can use a bonus action to create a sand dervish in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The sand dervish is a cylinder of whirling sand that is 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide. A creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sand dervish must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 slashing damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dervish. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.\n  As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the sand dervish up to 30 feet in any direction. If you ram the dervish into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the dervish's damage, and the dervish stops moving this turn. When you move the dervish, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and float it across pits up to 10 feet wide.\nThe sand dervish lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nWhen you reach 10th level in this class, the damage dealt by the dervish increases to 2d8.\n\n##### Echo of the Dunes\nAt 10th level, your connection with sand deepens, and you can call on the power of the deep dunes to do one of the following: \n* **Sand Sphere.** You can use an action to conjure a 20-foot radius sphere of thick, swirling sand at a point you can see within 90 feet. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature moving through the area must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. The sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). \n* **Whirlwind.** You can use an action to transform into a whirlwind of sand until the start of your next turn. While in this form, your movement speed is doubled, and your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While in whirlwind form, you have resistance to all damage, and you can't be grappled, petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned, but you also can't cast spells, can't make attacks, and can't manipulate objects that require fine dexterity.\nOnce you use one of these options, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Sandstorm\nAt 14th level, you can use an action to create a sandstorm of swirling wind and stinging sand. The storm rages in a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within 120 feet. The storm spreads around corners, its area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. The buffeting winds and sand make the area difficult terrain. The storm lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.\n  When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, it takes 2d8 slashing damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.\n  You are immune to the effects of the storm, and you can extend that immunity to a number of creatures that you can see within 120 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

                    "desc": "Druids of the Circle of the Green devote themselves to the plants and green things of the world, recognizing the role of plants in giving life. By continued communion with plant life, they believe they draw nearer to what they call \u201cThe Green,\u201d a cosmic thread that binds all plant life. Druids of this circle believe they gain their abilities by tapping into the Green, and they use this connection to summon a spirit from it.\n\n##### Circle Spells\nWhen you join this circle at 2nd level, you form a bond with a plant spirit, a creature of the Green. Your link with this spirit grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of the Green Spells table.\n  Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\n\n**Circle of the Green Spells**\n| Druid Level  | Spells                               | \n|--------------|--------------------------------------| \n| 2nd          | *entangle*, *goodberry*              | \n| 3rd          | *barkskin*, *spike growth*           | \n| 5th          | *speak with plants*, *vine carpet*   | \n| 7th          | *dreamwine*, *hallucinatory terrain* | \n| 9th          | *enchanted bloom*, *tree stride*     |\n\n##### Summon Green Spirit\nStarting at 2nd level, you can summon a spirit of the Green, a manifestation of primordial plant life. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon the Green spirit rather than assuming a beast form.\n  The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. When the spirit appears, the area in a 10-foot radius around it becomes tangled with vines and other plant growth, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.\n  The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Green Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.\n  You determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches and leaves, while others look like creatures with leafy bodies and heads made of gourds or fruit. Some even resemble beasts, only made entirely of plant material.\n  In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The green spirit can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n  The spirit remains for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die. When it manifests, the spirit bears 10 fruit that are infused with magic. Each fruit works like a berry created by the *goodberry* spell.\n\n##### Gift of the Green\nAt 6th level, the bond with your green spirit enhances your restorative spells and gives you the power to cast additional spells. Once before the spirit's duration ends, you can cast one of the following spells without expending a spell slot or material components: *locate animals or plants*, *pass without trace* (only in environments with ample plant life), *plant growth*, or *speak with plants*. You can't cast a spell this way again until the next time you summon your green spirit.\n  Whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points while your green spirit is summoned, roll a d8 and add the result to the total hit points restored.\n  In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your green spirit.\n\n##### Verdant Interference\nStarting at 10th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you or your green spirit is attacked, you can use your reaction to cause vines and vegetation to burst from the ground and grasp at the attacker, giving the attacker disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spirit Symbiosis\nAt 14th level, while your green spirit is within 30 feet of you, you can use an action to join with it, letting its plant matter grow around you. While so joined, you gain the following benefits: \n* You gain temporary hit points equal to your green spirit's current hit points. \n* You gain a climbing speed of 30 feet. \n* You have advantage on Constitution saving throws. \n* The ground within 10 feet of you is difficult terrain for creatures hostile to you. \n* You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to make a tendril attack against one creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 + your Wisdom modifier.\nThis feature lasts until the temporary hit points you gained from this feature are reduced to 0, until the spirit's duration ends, or until you use an action to separate. If you separate, the green spirit has as many hit points as you had temporary hit points remaining. If this effect ends because your temporary hit points are reduced to 0, the green spirit disappears until you summon it again.",

Druids of this circle also admire the adaptability of these gelatinous creatures and study them to learn how to duplicate some of their abilities.\n\nThe sworn enemies of Circle of the Shapeless druids are the so-called ooze lords and their servants who pervert the natural order by controlling and weaponizing such creatures.\n\n##### Circle Spells\nWhen you join this circle at 2nd level, your connection with oozes grants you access to certain spells. At 2nd level, you learn the *acid splash* cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Shapeless Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

You can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to take on an ooze-like form rather than transforming into a beast.\n  While in your ooze form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes less substantial and appears wet and slimy. Your skin may change in color and appearance, resembling other forms of ooze like black pudding, ochre jelly, gray ooze, or even translucent, like a gelatinous cube.\n  You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the equipment to move with you if you flow through particularly narrow spaces.\n  Your ooze form lasts for 10 minutes or until you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.\nWhile in ooze form, you gain the following benefits: \n* **Acid Weapons.** Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 acid damage on a hit. \n* **Amorphous.** You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. \n* **Climber.** You have a climbing speed of 20 feet. \n* **Oozing Form.** When a creature touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 acid damage to that creature.\n\n##### Slimy Pseudopod\nAt 6th level, you can use a bonus action to cause an oozing pseudopod to erupt from your body for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. On the turn you activate this feature, and as a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you can make a melee spell attack with the pseudopod against a creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 acid damage.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you reach 10th level in this class, the acid damage dealt by your pseudopod increases to 2d6.\n\n##### Improved Ooze Form\nAt 10th level, your ooze form becomes more powerful. It now lasts 1 hour, and the acid damage dealt by your Acid Weapons and Oozing Form increases to 2d6.\n\n##### Engulfing Embrace\nAt 14th level, while in your ooze form, you can use an action to move into the space of a creature within 5 feet of you that is your size or smaller and try to engulf it. The target creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.\n  On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet away from you or to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.\n  On a failed save, you enter the creature's space, and the creature takes 2d6 acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature is restrained and has total cover against attacks and other effects outside of your body. The engulfed creature takes 4d6 acid damage at the start of each of your subsequent turns. When you move, the engulfed creature moves with you.\n  An engulfed creature can attempt to escape by taking an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of you.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to try to engulf another creature.",

You and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you end the grappled or restrained conditions. You can fly up to 30 feet as part of this bonus action, and each creature that you affect with this wind can use a reaction to fly up to 30 feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.\n\n##### Vizier of the Winds\nStarting at 10th level, you can ask the winds one question, and they whisper secrets back to you. You can cast *commune* without preparing the spell or expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Hunger of Storm's Fury\nBeginning at 14th level, when you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or effect that deals lightning damage, you take no damage and instead regain a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. \n \nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell. \n \n##### Nature's Ward \n \nWhen you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease. \n \n##### Nature's Sanctuary \n \nWhen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. \n \nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you. \n \n> ### Sacred Plants and Wood \n> \n> A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe. \n> \n> Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins. \n> \n> Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants. \n \n> ### Druids and the Gods \n> \n> Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.",

Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, \u201cEquipment\u201d) as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. \n \n### Wild Shape \n \nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. \n \nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. \n \n**Beast Shapes (table)** \n \n| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     | \n|-------|---------|-----------------------------|-------------| \n| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        | \n| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   | \n| 8th   | 1       | -                           | Giant eagle | \n \nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. \n \nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply: \n \n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. \n* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious. \n* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast. \n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. \n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. \n \n### Druid Circle \n \nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Timeless Body \n \nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. \n \n### Beast Spells \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components. \n \n### Archdruid \n \nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times. \n \nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.",

These chaplains typically come from religious sects whose tenets promote war, healing, peace, protection, or freedom, and they tend to the emotional and physical well-being of their charges. In the eyes of your companions, you are as much a counselor and spiritual leader as you are a fellow warrior.\n\n##### Student of Faith\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight, Medicine, or Religion skill (your choice).\n\n##### Field Medic\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use an action to spend one of your Hit Dice and regain hit points. The hit points regained with this feature can be applied to yourself or to another creature you touch. Alternatively, you can heal another creature you touch when you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points during a short rest, instead of applying the regained hit points to yourself. If you are under an effect that increases the amount of healing you receive when spending Hit Dice, such as a spell or feat, that effect applies to the amount of hit points the target regains. Keep in mind, some effects that increase the healing of Hit Dice happen only when those Hit Dice are spent during a short rest, like a bard's Song of Rest.\n  In addition, the number of Hit Dice you regain after a long rest is equal to half your total number of Hit Dice plus one. For example, if you have four Hit Dice, you regain three spent Hit Dice, instead of two, when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Rally the Troops\nStarting at 7th level, you can use an action to urge your companions to overcome emotional and spiritual obstacles. Each friendly creature of your choice that can see or hear you (which can include yourself) ignores the effects of being charmed and frightened for 1 minute.\n  If a creature affected by this feature is already suffering from one of the conditions it can ignore, that condition is suppressed for the duration and resumes when this feature ends. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n  Each target can ignore additional conditions when you reach certain levels in this class: one level of exhaustion and incapacitated at 10th level, up to two levels of exhaustion and stunned at 15th level, and up to three levels of exhaustion and paralyzed at 17th level.\n\n##### Tend the Injured\nAt 10th level, if you spend Hit Dice to recover hit points during a short rest, any hit points regained that exceed your hit point maximum, or that of the creature being tended to, can be applied to another creature within 5 feet of you. In addition, you regain one spent Hit Die when you finish a short rest.\n\n##### Rally Point\nBeginning at 15th level, when a friendly creature you can see takes damage, you can use your reaction to move that creature up to its speed toward you. The creature can choose the path traveled, but it must end the movement closer to you than it started. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Hospitaler\nAt 18th level, you recover a number of spent Hit Dice equal to a quarter of your total Hit Dice when you finish a short rest. In addition, you recover all your spent Hit Dice when you finish a long rest.",

On your first attack each round, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls if at least one friendly creature is within 5 feet of you.\n\n##### Move As One\nAt 3rd level, at any point while moving on your turn, you can command a number of willing, friendly creatures within 5 feet of you up to your proficiency bonus to move with you. Each creature that chooses to move with you can use a reaction to move up to its speed alongside you, remaining within 5 feet of you while moving. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.\n\n##### Tactical Positioning\nAt 15th level, moving through a hostile creature's space is not difficult terrain for you, and you can move through a hostile creature's space even if it is only one size larger or smaller than you. As normal, you can't end your move in a hostile creature's space.\n\n##### Cooperative Strike\nStarting at 18th level, when you use the Attack action and attack with a weapon while at least one friendly creature is within 5 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to make one additional attack with that weapon.",

They know the intense, close, violent intimacy of melee, and they operate unapologetically in that space. Whether in fighting pits by the docks to make some extra coin, in the king's grand arena as champions of quarreling nobles, or in the employ of local merchants in need of seemingly weaponless guards, pugilists can be found in all rungs of society. Pugilists take pleasure in a battle hard won and thrill in the energy of the fight rather than in a kill. They can often be found celebrating or having drinks with a former opponent hours after the fight, regardless of the bout's winner.\n\n##### Unarmed Warrior\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to use your fists, knees, elbows, head, and feet to attack your opponents. You gain the following benefits while you are not wearing heavy armor and while you are not wielding weapons or a shield: \n* Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. Your unarmed strike damage increases as you reach higher levels. The d6 becomes a d8 at 10th level and a d10 at 18th level. \n* When you use the Attack action to make one or more unarmed strikes, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.\n\n##### Resilient Fighter\nStarting at 3rd level, you learn to endure great amounts of physical punishment. You add your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) to any death saving throw you make. In addition, you can use Second Wind a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Uncanny Fortitude\nBeginning at 7th level, if damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, when you use Second Wind, you now regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level + your Constitution modifier.\n\n##### Debilitating Blow\nAt 10th level, when you hit one target with two unarmed strikes in the same turn, you can use a bonus action to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failure, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.\n\n##### Withstand Death\nAt 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use Second Wind as a reaction, provided you have uses of Second Wind remaining. You can decide to use this reaction before or after your Uncanny Fortitude feature triggers.\n  In addition, when you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as one failure instead of two.\n\n##### Opportunistic Brawler\nStarting at 18th level, you might not look for a fight around every corner, but you're ready in case one happens. You have advantage on initiative rolls.\n  In addition, when a creature you can see enters a space within 5 feet of you, you can make one opportunity attack against the creature. This opportunity attack must be made with an unarmed strike. You have a number of reactions each turn equal to your proficiency bonus, but these reactions can be used only to perform opportunity attacks.",

You wield a spear, glaive, halberd, or other polearm as a piercing ray of sunlight against your enemies.\n\n##### Harassing Strike\nBeginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, when a creature you can see enters your reach, you can use your reaction to Shove the creature. To use this feature, you must be wielding a glaive, halberd, lance, pike, or spear.\n\n##### Radiant Fighting\nStarting at 3rd level, when you deal damage with a glaive, halberd, lance, pike, or spear, you can choose for the damage to be radiant instead of its normal damage type.\n\n##### Formation Tactics\nAt 7th level, you bolster your allies when fighting shoulder to shoulder. While you have an ally within 5 feet of you who isn't incapacitated, you can use a bonus action to take the Help action to assist that ally's attack roll or their next Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.\n\n##### Foe of Darkness\nBeginning at 10th level, your faith and training make you a daunting foe of dark creatures. Once per turn, you can have advantage on an attack roll or ability check made against a fiend, undead, or creature of shadow.\n\n##### Give Ground\nStarting at 15th level, once per turn when you are hit by a melee attack, you can choose to move 5 feet away from the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks. If you do, the attacker takes 1d6 radiant damage. To use this feature, you must be wielding a glaive, halberd, lance, pike, or spear.\n\n##### The Sun's Protection\nAt 18th level, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. If you fail a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",

The timeblade augments physical attacks by manipulating temporal powers and eventually learns to step outside time itself.\n\n##### Temporal Strike\nStarting at 3rd level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to trigger one of the following effects: \n* **Dislocative Step.** You step outside of time and move to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. At 10th level, you can move up to 30 feet. \n* **Dislocative Shove.** You push the target of your attack to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. You can move the target only horizontally, and before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, the target can make a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier), ending the movement in an unoccupied space next to the damaging terrain on a success. At 10th level, you can move the target up to 30 feet.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Chronologic Echo\nAt 7th level, immediately after you use your Second Wind feature, you can trigger an echo in time, allowing you to use it twice. Roll separately for each use of Second Wind. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Improved Temporal Strike\nAt 10th level, when you use your Temporal Strike feature, you can choose one of the following additional options: \n* **Chronal Cleave.** You immediately make a weapon attack against a different target within range. \n* **Chronal Shield.** You add your proficiency bonus to your Armor Class until the beginning of your next turn.\n\n##### Continuity Rift\nAt 15th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can instantly open a rupture in spacetime to swallow the target. The creature disappears and falls through a realm outside of reality.\n  At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. It takes 8d8 psychic damage as it grapples with the mind-breaking experience. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or it acts randomly for 1 minute as if under the effects of the *confusion* spell. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Temporal Warrior\nStarting at 18th level, you can momentarily step outside of time to attack your foes. As an action, you can briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal. This effect works like the *time stop* spell, except you can make one attack on each of your turns without ending the effect. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

While the techniques of the tunnel watchers originated with the dwarves, others see the value in such specialization. Tunnel watchers can thus be found throughout the mountainous regions of the world.\n\n##### Bonus Proficiencies\nAt 3rd level, you gain proficiency with thieves' tools and mason's tools.\n\n##### First Line of Defense\nStarting at 3rd level, a creature that you hit with a melee weapon attack has its speed reduced by 5 feet and can't use the Disengage action until the start of your next turn. You can't reduce a creature's speed by more than 10 feet with this feature.\n  In addition, when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's type.\n\n##### Fight for Every Step\nAt 3rd level, when you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your reaction to move 5 feet away from the attacker, reducing the damage you take from the attack by 1d6 + the number of hostile creatures within 5 feet of the space you left. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.\n  The attacker can immediately move into the space you left. This movement doesn't cost the attacker's reaction and doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, but a creature can move this way only once each turn.\n\n##### Safe Passage\nStarting at 7th level, you have advantage on saving throws against traps, natural hazards, and lair actions. Traps, natural hazards, and lair actions have disadvantage when they make attack rolls against you.\n\n##### Steadfast\nAt 10th level, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause the frightened condition and effects that would move you against your will, including teleportation effects. When a hostile creature forces you to make a Strength saving throw and you succeed, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's type the next time you hit with a weapon attack before the end of your next turn.\n\n##### Cave-In\nStarting at 15th level, once on each of your turns when you use the Attack action, you can replace one of your attacks with a strike against a wall or ceiling within your weapon's reach or range. Creatures other than you within 5 feet of the section of wall or the floor below the ceiling where you strike must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).\n  A creature that fails this saving throw takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage and is restrained until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half the damage and isn't restrained. While restrained in this way, a creature has three-quarters cover against creatures other than you. When the effect ends, the creature's space becomes difficult terrain.\n\n##### Against the Tide\nBeginning at 18th level, when you use the Attack action and hit more than one creature with a weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn. When you shove more than one creature on your turn, you can use a bonus action to shove one creature within 5 feet of a creature you successfully shoved.",

The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n \n#### Protection \n \nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n \n#### Two-Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. \n \n### Second Wind \n \nYou have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm.

On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

The tradition combines tactical disciplines designed to encourage groups to work as one unit with practical strategies for enhancing allies. Where many warrior-monks view ki as a power best kept within, the Way of Concordant Motion teaches its followers to project their ki into their allies through ascetic meditation and mental exercises. Followers of this tradition value teamwork and promote functioning as a cohesive whole above any search for triumph or glory.\n\n##### Cooperative Ki\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you spend ki on certain features, you can share some of the effects with your allies.\n\n***Flurry of Blows.*** When you spend ki to use Flurry of Blows, you can use a bonus action to empower up to two allies you can see within 30 feet of you instead of making two unarmed strikes. The next time an empowered ally hits a creature with an attack before the start of your next turn, the ally's attack deals extra damage of the attack's type equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die *+* your Wisdom modifier.\n\n***Patient Defense.*** When you spend ki to use Patient Defense, you can spend 1 additional ki point to share this defense with one ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally can immediately use the Dodge action as a reaction.\n\n***Step of the Wind.*** When you spend ki to use Step of the Wind, you can spend 1 additional ki point to share your mobility with one ally you can see within 30 feet of you. That ally can use a reaction to immediately move up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.\n\n##### Deflect Strike\nAt 6th level, when an ally you can see within 30 feet is hit by a melee attack, you can spend 2 ki points as a reaction to move up to half your speed toward the ally. If you move to within 5 feet of the ally, the damage the ally takes from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If this reduces the damage to 0, you can immediately make one unarmed strike against the attacker.\n\n##### Coordinated Maneuvers\nStarting at 11th level, when you use your Cooperative Ki feature to share your Patient Defense or Step of the Wind, you can target a number of allies equal to your proficiency bonus. You must spend 1 ki point for each ally you target.\n  In addition, when you use your Cooperative Ki feature to empower your allies with your Flurry of Blows, you can make two unarmed strikes as part of the same bonus action.\n\n##### Concordant Mind\nAt 17th level, you have mastered the ability to empower your allies with your ki. As an action, you can expend 5 ki points and empower each ally of your choice within 30 feet of you. Each empowered ally immediately gains the benefits of all three of your Cooperative Ki features. This allows each empowered ally to both move and take the Dodge action as a reaction. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Once they are trained, followers of this Way travel far and wide, rarely settling in one place for long.\n\n##### Draconic Affiliation\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you feel an affinity for one type of dragon, which you choose from the Draconic Affiliation table. You model your fighting style to match that type of dragon, and some of the features you gain from following this Way depend upon the affiliation you chose.\n\n| Dragon              | Associated Skill  | Damage Type | \n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------| \n| Black or Copper     | Stealth           | Acid        | \n| Blue or Bronze      | Insight           | Lightning   | \n| Brass, Gold, or Red | Intimidation      | Fire        | \n| Green               | Deception         | Poison      | \n| Silver or White     | History           | Cold        |\n\nWhen you make your selection, you gain proficiency in the dragon's associated skill, and you gain resistance to the listed damage type. If you already have this skill proficiency, you double your proficiency bonus with that skill.\n\n##### Draconic Onslaught\nAt 3rd level, when you use Step of the Wind then hit with an attack, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation.\n\n##### Take Flight\nStarting at 6th level, when you take the Dash action, you can spend 1 ki point to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn. While you are flying, a creature that hits you with an opportunity attack takes 2d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation.\n\n##### Conquering Wyrm\nBeginning at 11th level, when you take the Attack action after using Step of the Wind in the same turn, you can spend an extra 2 ki points to replace your first attack with one unarmed strike against each creature within 5 feet of the space in which you end your movement. On a hit, your unarmed strike deals an extra 4d6 of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation. You can't use this feature and your Draconic Onslaught feature in the same round.\n\n##### Scales of the Wyrm\nAt 17th level, you can harden yourself against harm like the eldest of dragons. On your turn, you can spend 4 ki points to increase your Armor Class by 2, gain temporary hit points equal to your monk level, and gain immunity to the frightened condition for 10 minutes. For the duration, when you take damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take from that source to 0.",

A large part of their training involves traveling through their home region and assisting local farmers and common folk with problems ranging from rebuilding burned homes to dispatching troublesome bandits. In areas where their Way is known, adherents are welcomed into the community and their needs are seen to in exchange for the host of benefits their presence brings to the community.\n\n##### Slow to Anger\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you use Patient Defense and an attack hits you, you can use your reaction to halve the damage that you take. When you use Patient Defense and a melee attack made by a creature within your reach misses you, you can use your reaction to force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is knocked prone.\n  When you use either of these reactions, you can spend 1 ki point. If you do, your first melee weapon attack that hits before the end of your next turn deals extra damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.\n\n##### Unyielding Step\nStarting at 6th level, you can spend 1 ki point on your turn to ignore difficult terrain for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, your speed can't be reduced below 15 feet. If you use this feature while grappled, the creature can use its reaction to move with you whenever you move; otherwise, the grapple ends. If you use this feature while restrained but not grappled, such as by a spider's web, you break free from the restraining material unless it is capable of moving with you.\n\n##### Decisive in Wrath\nAt 11th level, when you spend 1 ki point as part of your Slow to Anger feature, all of your melee weapon attacks that hit before the end of your next turn deal extra damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.\n\n##### Thick Hide\nAt 17th level, you can spend 5 ki points as a bonus action to gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 10 minutes.",

Many adherents live a pacifistic lifestyle and never seek conflict. When strife finds them, though, they deal with it in a swift and decisive use of power and grace.\n\n##### Perfect Calm\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you spend a ki point on Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, or Step of the Wind, you also have advantage on one saving throw of your choice that you make before the end of your next turn.\n\n##### Turbulent Waters\nStarting at 3rd level, when an attack made by a hostile creature misses you or you succeed on a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a Turbulence die, which is the same type as your Martial Arts die. You can have a maximum number of Turbulence dice equal to your proficiency bonus. When you hit with an attack, you can roll any number of Turbulence dice and add the total result to the damage you deal. Turbulence dice that result in a 1 or 2 are expended, otherwise you don't expend Turbulence dice when you add them to the damage you deal. You lose all accumulated Turbulence dice when you haven't made an attack or been the target of an attack by a hostile creature for 1 minute.\n\n##### Spreading Ripples\nAt 6th level, when a creature within 10 feet of you and friendly to you is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a Turbulence die.\n  When you hit with an attack and use two or more Turbulence dice on the attack's damage, you can choose one creature within 10 feet of your target that you can see. That creature takes damage equal to the roll of one of the Turbulence dice you rolled. If you spend 1 ki point, you can instead choose any number of creatures within 10 feet of your target to take that amount of damage.\n\n##### Duality of Water\nBeginning at 11th level, when you have no Turbulence dice, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, and you have resistance to fire damage. When you have at least one Turbulence die, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and you have resistance to cold damage.\n\n##### Tempestuous Waters\nAt 17th level, when you spend any number of ki points, you can also choose to gain an equal number of Turbulence dice, up to your proficiency bonus.",

Their school of fighting is typified by its low-standing stance, periods of swaying in place punctuated with bursts of wild, staggering movement, and the disorienting manner in which they seem to never be in the place they appear to be standing.\n  Despite the name of their style, monks of this Way often abstain from drinking alcohol, though they are not prohibited from doing so. Many do, however, display traits of their patron monkey in their love of jests and their easy laughter, even in the most fraught situations.\n\n##### Adaptive Fighting\nMonks of the Way of the Tipsy Monkey keep their foes off-balance by using unexpected things as weapons. Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you are proficient with improvised weapons, and you can treat them as monk weapons. When you use a magic item as an improvised weapon, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls with that improvised weapon based on the magic item's rarity: +1 for uncommon, +2 for rare, or +3 for very rare. At the GM's discretion, some magic items, such as rings or other magical jewelry, might not be viable as improvised weapons.\n\n##### Sway and Strike\nAt 3rd level, your unpredictable movements let you take advantage of more openings. Once per round when an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can spend 1 ki point to make an opportunity attack without spending your reaction. If this attack hits, you can force the target to roll a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it falls prone.\n\n##### Jester Style\nBeginning at 6th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to halve the damage that you take.\n  When you are prone, you don't have disadvantage on attack rolls, and enemies within 5 feet of you don't have advantage on attack rolls against you. You can stand up without spending movement anytime you spend ki on your turn.\n  You have advantage on any ability check or saving throw you make to escape from a grapple. If you fail to escape a grapple, you can spend 1 ki point to succeed instead.\n\n##### Fortune Favors the Fool\nStarting at 11th level, when you miss with an attack on your turn, the next attack you make that hits a target before the end of your turn deals an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type. If you make that attack using an improvised weapon, it deals an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type instead.\n\n##### Stumbling Stance\nAt 17th level, your staggering movements make you dangerous at a distance and make it difficult for foes to safely move away from you. If your speed is not 0, your reach is extended by 5 feet, and you have advantage on opportunity attacks.",

Some are dedicated soldiers, others walk the path of a wandering warrior-mendicant, but all of them hone their art of self-control, spirituality, and the martial arts, combining unarmed combat with archery. Select this tradition if you want to play a character who is as comfortable trading kicks and blows as they are with snatching an arrow from the air and firing it back in a single motion.\n\n##### Archery Training\nWhen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your particular martial arts training guides you to master the use of bows. The shortbow and longbow are monk weapons for you. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with shortbows or longbows.\n  When you make an unarmed strike as a bonus action as part of your Martial Arts feature or as part of a Flurry of Blows, you can choose for the unarmed strike to deal piercing damage as you jab the target with an arrow.\n\n##### Flurry of Deflection\nAt 3rd level, you get additional reactions equal to your proficiency bonus, but these reactions can be used only for your Deflect Missiles monk class feature. If you reduce the damage of the ranged weapon attack to 0 and the missile can be fired with a shortbow or longbow, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with your shortbow or longbow, using the missile you caught as ammunition.\n  At 9th level, when you use Deflect Missiles, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 2d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.\n\n##### Needle Eye of Insight\nAt 6th level, your attacks with shortbows and longbows count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, when you make a ranged attack with a shortbow or longbow, you can spend 1 ki point to cause your ranged attacks to ignore half cover and three-quarters cover until the start of your next turn.\n\n##### Steel Rain Blossom\nAt 11th level, you can fire arrows in a deadly rain. While wielding a shortbow or longbow, you can use an action to fire an arcing arrow at a point you can see within your weapon's normal range. As the arrow descends onto the point, it magically replicates into dozens of arrows. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take piercing damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die. A creature behind total cover automatically succeeds on this saving throw. You can increase the steel rain's damage by spending ki points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the damage by one Martial Arts die.\n  In addition, when you would make an unarmed strike as a bonus action as part of your Martial Arts feature or as part of a Flurry of Blows, you can choose to make a ranged attack with a shortbow or longbow instead.\n\n##### Improbable Shot\nAt 17th level, when you use your Needle Eye of Insight feature to ignore cover, you can spend 3 ki points to ignore all forms of cover instead. The arrow even passes through solid barriers, provided you have seen the target within the past minute and it is within your weapon's normal range.\n  Alternatively, you can spend 5 ki points to strike a target you have seen within the past minute that is now on a different plane or in an extradimensional space, such as through the *plane shift* or *rope trick* spells or a phase spider's Ethereal Jaunt trait. If you do so, you can't use this feature in this way again until you finish a long rest.",

Embodying the Way of the Wildcat requires intense devotion, endless practice, and no small amount of daring.\n\n##### Enhanced Agility\nWhen you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill if you don't already have it. When you move at least 10 feet on your turn, you have advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you make before the start of your next turn.\n\n##### Feline Reflexes\nAlso at 3rd level, the inner power infusing your reflexes augments your nimbleness and makes it harder to hit you. When a creature you can see misses you with an attack, the next attack against you before the start of your next turn is made with disadvantage. This can happen only once each turn. If you spend 2 ki points when a creature you can see misses you with an attack, you can take the Dodge action as a reaction instead.\n  You can't benefit from this feature if your speed is 0.\n\n##### Springing Pounce\nStarting at 6th level, when you move at least 10 feet straight toward a creature and hit it with an attack on the same turn, you can spend 1 ki point to channel your momentum into your attack, dealing extra damage or pushing the target (your choice). If dealing extra damage, the attack deals extra damage of the weapon's type equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier. If pushing the target, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from you. If you used Step of the Wind to Dash before making the attack, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.\n  You can use this feature only once per turn.\n\n##### Improved Feline Reflexes\nStarting at 11th level, when you take no damage after succeeding on a Dexterity saving throw as a result of the Evasion monk class feature, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward the source of the effect, such as the dragon or spellcaster that exhaled the lightning or cast the *fireball* that you avoided. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the source, you can spend 3 ki points to make one unarmed strike against it.\n\n##### Hundred Step Strike\nAt 17th level, you can use your Springing Pounce feature as many times each turn as you want, provided you have the movement and attacks to do so. You must still spend 1 ki point each time you channel your momentum into your attack. Each time you move after hitting a creature in this way, you don't provoke opportunity attacks. If you miss an attack, further movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal.\n  If you use Flurry of Blows with Springing Pounce and hit a different creature with each attack, you can make one additional Springing Pounce attack without spending ki, provided you have the movement to do so.",

They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm. \n \n##### Open Hand Technique \n \nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target: \n* It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. \n* It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you. \n* It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn. \n \n##### Wholeness of Body \n \nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. \n \n##### Tranquility \n \nBeginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a *sanctuary* spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. \n \n##### Quivering Palm \n \nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage. \n \nYou can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.",

Through research, they prepare themselves against the ever-coming tides of evil. Through careful training, they have learned to puncture and manipulate the spiritual flow of an opponent\u2019s body. Through understanding the secrets of their foe, they can adapt and surmount them. Then, once the fight is done, they return to record their findings for future generations of monks to study from.\n\n##### Mystical Erudition\nUpon choosing this tradition at 3rd level, you\u2019ve undergone extensive training with the Cerulean Spirit, allowing you to mystically recall information on history and lore from the monastery\u2019s collected volumes. Whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (History), or Intelligence (Religion) check, you can spend 1 ki point to gain advantage on the roll.\nIn addition, you learn one language of your choice. You gain additional languages at 11th and 17th level.\n\n##### Extract Aspects\nBeginning at 3rd level when choosing this tradition, when you pummel an opponent and connect with multiple pressure points, you can extract crucial information about your foe. Whenever you hit a single creature with two or more attacks in one round, you can spend 1 ki point to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you learn one aspect about the creature of your choice: Creature Type, Armor Class, Senses, Highest Saving Throw Modifier, Lowest Saving Throw Modifier, Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage Immunities, or Condition Immunities.\nUpon reaching 6th level, if the target fails their saving throw, you can choose two aspects to learn. This increases to three aspects at 11th level, and four aspects at 17th level.\n\n##### Extort Truth\nAt 6th level, you can hit a series of hidden nerves on a creature with precision, temporarily causing them to be unable to mask their true thoughts and intent. If you manage to hit a single creature with two or more attacks in one round, you can spend 2 ki points to force them to make a Charisma saving throw. You can choose to have these attacks deal no damage. On a failed save, the creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie for 1 minute. You know if they succeeded or failed on their saving throw.\nAn affected creature is aware of the effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as the effect lasts.\n\n##### Mind of Mercury\nStarting at 6th level, you\u2019ve honed your awareness and reflexes through mental aptitude and pattern recognition. You can take a number of additional reactions each round equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), at the cost of 1 ki point per reaction beyond the first. You can only use one reaction per trigger.\nIn addition, whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check, you can spend 1 ki point to gain advantage on the roll.\n\n##### Preternatural Counter\nBeginning at 11th level, your quick mind and study of your foe allows you to use their failure to your advantage. If a creature misses you with an attack, you can immediately use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.\n\n##### Debilitating Barrage\nUpon reaching 17th level, you\u2019ve gained the knowledge to temporarily alter and lower a creature\u2019s fortitude by striking a series of pressure points. Whenever you hit a single creature with three or more attacks in one round, you can spend 3 ki points to give the creature disadvantage to their attack rolls until the end of your next turn, and they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers vulnerability to a damage type of your choice for 1 minute, or until after they take any damage of that type.\nCreatures with resistance or immunity to the chosen damage type do not suffer this vulnerability, which is revealed after the damage type is chosen. You can select the damage type from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, thunder.",

            "desc": "### Unarmored Defense \n \nBeginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. \n \n### Martial Arts \n \nAt 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two- handed or heavy property. \n \nYou gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield: \n \n* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. \n* You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. \n* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. \n \nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon. \n \n### Ki \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table. \n \nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class. \n \nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points. \n \nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows: \n \n**Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n#### Flurry of Blows \n \nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action. \n \n#### Patient Defense \n \nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. \n \n#### Step of the Wind \n \nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn. \n \n### Unarmored Movement \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table. \n \nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. \n \n### Monastic Tradition \n \nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level. \n \n### Deflect Missiles \n \nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. \n \nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Slow Fall \n \nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Stunning Strike \n \nStarting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. \n \n### Ki-Empowered Strikes \n \nStarting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. \n \n### Evasion \n \nAt 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a *fireball* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n \n### Stillness of Mind \n \nStarting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened. \n \n### Purity of Body \n \nAt 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison. \n \n### Tongue of the Sun and Moon \n \nStarting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say. \n \n### Diamond Soul \n \nBeginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws. \n \nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result. \n \n### Timeless Body \n \nAt 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water. \n \n### Empty Body \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. \n \nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *astral projection* spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other creatures with you. \n \n### Perfect Self \n \nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points. \n \n### Monastic Traditions \n \nThree traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.",

                    "desc": "The Oath of Justice is a commitment not to the tenets of good or evil but a holy vow sworn to uphold the laws of a nation, a city, or even a tiny village. When lawlessness threatens the peace, those who swear to uphold the Oath of Justice intervene to maintain order, for if order falls to lawlessness, it is only a matter of time before all of civilization collapses into anarchy.\n  While many young paladins take this oath to protect their country and the people close to them from criminals, some older adherents to this oath know that what is just is not necessarily what is right.\n\n##### Tenets of Justice\nAll paladins of justice uphold the law in some capacity, but their oath differs depending on their station. A paladin who serves a queen upholds slightly different tenets than one who serves a small town.\n\n***Uphold the Law.*** The law represents the triumph of civilization over the untamed wilds. It must be preserved at all costs.\n\n***Punishment Fits the Crime.*** The severity of justice acts in equal measure to the severity of a wrongdoer's transgressions. Oath Spells You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Justice Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.\n\n**Oath of Justice Spells (table)**\n| Paladin Level  | Spells                              | \n|----------------|-------------------------------------| \n| 3rd            | *color spray*, *guiding bolt*       | \n| 5th            | *guiding bolt*, *zone of truth*     | \n| 9th            | *lightning bolt*, *slow*            | \n| 13th           | *faithful hound*, *locate creature* | \n| 17th           | *arcane hand*, *hold monster*       |\n\n##### Channel Divinity\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\n\n***Tether of Righteousness.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to bind your target to you. As an action, you extend a line of energy toward a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is tethered and can't move more than 30 feet away from you for 1 minute. While tethered, the target takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) at the end of each of its turns. You can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by the tethered creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the creature's choice). On a success, you can pull the creature up to 15 feet in a straight line toward you. As an action, the tethered creature can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it breaks the tether.\n\n***Justicar's Celerity.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to respond to danger with lightning speed. When a creature that you can see is attacked, you can move up to your speed as a reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the attacker, you can make one melee attack against it as part of this reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the target of the attack, you can become the target of the attack instead as part of this reaction.\n\n##### Disciplined Pursuant\nAt 7th level, you can bend the laws of magic to parallel the laws of civilization. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a spell or Divine Smite, you can choose to knock out the creature instead of killing it. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\n  In addition, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to a creature, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. If you deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one creature to be affected by this feature.\n\n##### Shackles of Light\nStarting at 15th level, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to a creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is restrained by golden, spectral chains until the end of its next turn. If you deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one such creature to be affected by this feature. The target of this feature can be different from the target of your Disciplined Pursuant feature.\n\n##### Avatar of Perfect Order\nAt 20th level, you can take on the appearance of justice itself. As an action, you become wreathed in a garment of cold light. For 1 minute, you benefit from the following effects: \n* You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. \n* You can use your Justicar's Celerity feature without expending a use of Channel Divinity. \n* When a creature you can see takes the Attack or Cast a Spell action, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must take a different action of your choice instead.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

                    "desc": "Paladins who choose the Oath of Safeguarding spend their lives in service to others, conserving the people and places they vow to protect. They take missions to guard against assassination attempts, safely transport a person or group through treacherous lands, and stand as bastions for locations under attack. These paladins are no mere mercenaries, however, as they view their missions as sacred vows.\n\n##### Tenets of Safeguarding\nPaladins undertaking the Oath of Safeguarding take their responsibilities seriously and are most likely to seek atonement should they fail in their duties. However, they have no qualms about terminating their protection when their charges prove nefarious. In these cases, they won't leave people stranded in a hostile environment or situation, but they also focus their efforts on their allies over unworthy, former charges. Even when these paladins serve no charge, they seek opportunities to shield others from harm. In combat, they rush to aid their allies and stand alone to allow others to flee from battle.\n\n***Last Line of Defense.*** When your allies must retreat or regroup, you remain to ensure they have ample time to withdraw before withdrawing yourself. If your mission requires you to guard a building, you are the final obstacle the attackers face before breaching the building.\n\n***Protect the Charge.*** You pledge to preserve the lives of people you protect and the sanctity of all structures you guard, even if it means endangering yourself. When you must rest, you ensure your charge is as safe as possible, turning to trusted allies to aid you.\n\n***Shield All Innocents.*** In the absence of a sacred charge to protect, you endeavor to keep all those who can't defend themselves safe from harm. In cases where your charge must take priority, you do what you can to defend the helpless.\n\n***Uphold the Vow.*** You acknowledge the person you protect may reveal themselves as unworthy, such as by committing nefarious acts or exploiting your protection and fidelity, or the location you guard may become a site of terrible acts. When you witness this, you are free to terminate your guardianship. However, you don't leave your now-former charge in any present danger, if only for the possibility of future atonement.\n\n ***Unwavering.*** Nothing shall distract you from your mission. If you are magically compelled to desert your post, you do your utmost to resume your duty. Failing that, you take out your vengeance on the party responsible for your dereliction.\n\n##### Oath Spells\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Safeguarding Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.\n\n **Oath of Safeguarding Spells (table)**\n| Paladin Level  | Spells                                 | \n|----------------|----------------------------------------| \n| 3rd            | *longstrider,*, *shield of faith*      | \n| 5th            | *hold person*, *spike growth*          | \n| 9th            | *beacon of hope*, *spirit guardians*   | \n| 13th           | *dimension door*, *stoneskin*          | \n| 17th           | *greater restoration*, *wall of stone* |\n\n##### Channel Divinity\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\n\n***Insurmountable Passage.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and stamp one foot on the ground. The ground within 60 feet of you magically becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. When you use this feature, you can designate up to 10 creatures that can ignore the difficult terrain.\n\n***Protect from Harm.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak reassuring words. For 1 minute, each friendly creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you has advantage on saving throws against spells and abilities that deal damage. In addition, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn.\n\n##### Aura of Preservation\nBeginning at 7th level, you emit an aura of safety while you're not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction. The first time you or a friendly creature within the aura would take damage from a weapon attack between the end of your previous turn and the start of your next turn, the target of the attack has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, each friendly creature within the aura has advantage on death saving throws.\n  When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet, and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n##### Battlefield Controller\nStarting at 15th level, you can't be shoved. When a hostile creature within 10 feet of you moves more than 10 feet away from you, you can use your reaction to move up to 10 feet and make an attack against that creature.\n\n##### Redoubtable Defender\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can touch your charge, typically a creature or structure, and create a magical link between you, which appears as a razor-thin, ghostly silver tether. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits: \n* You know the general status and well-being of your charge, such as if your charge is wounded or experiencing a particularly strong emotion, or, in the case of an object or structure, if it is damaged. \n* As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your charge, if it is a person or object. If the charge is a structure, you can choose to teleport to any unoccupied space within the structure. \n* You are immune to spells and effects that cause you to be charmed or might otherwise influence you to harm your charge. \n* If your charge is a creature and within 5 feet of you, the charge is immune to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it has advantage on all saving throws. \n* You can use an action to erect a barrier for 1 minute, similar to a *wall of force*, to protect your charge. The wall can be a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 5 feet, or four contiguous 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. If your charge is a structure, the barrier can cut through portions of the structure without harming it.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Such paladins might also serve a genie, elemental deity, or other powerful elemental creature.\n\n##### Tenets of the Elements\nThough exact interpretations and words of the Oath of the Elements vary between those who serve the subtle, elemental spirits of the world and those who serve elemental deities or genies, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\n\n***Defend the Natural World.*** Every mountaintop, valley, cave, stream, and spring is sacred. You would fight to your last breath to protect natural places from harm.\n\n***Lead the Line.*** You stand at the forefront of every battle as a beacon of hope to lead your allies to victory.\n\n ***Act Wisely, Act Decisively.*** You weigh your actions carefully and offer counsel to those who would behave impulsively. When the time is right, you unleash the fury of the elements upon your enemies.\n\n ***Integrity.*** Your word is your bond. You don't lie or deceive others and always treat them with fairness.\n\n##### Oath Spells\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Elements Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.\n\n**Oath of the Elements Spells (table)**\n| Paladin Level  | Spells                                     | \n|----------------|--------------------------------------------| \n| 3rd            | *burning hands*, *thunderwave*            | \n| 5th            | *acid arrow*, *flaming sphere*             | \n| 9th            | *call lightning*, *protection from energy* | \n| 13th           | *conjure minor elementals*, *ice storm*    | \n| 17th           | *conjure elemental*, *wall of stone*       |\n\n##### Elemental Language\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you learn to speak, read, and write Primordial.\n\n##### Channel Divinity\nAt 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\n\n***Abjure the Otherworldly.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke elementals and fiends. As an action, you present your holy symbol and recite ancient edicts from when the elements ruled the world. Each elemental or fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\n  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\n\n##### Elemental Strike.\nAs a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to magically imbue one weapon you are holding with the power of the elements. Choose air, earth, fire, or water. For 1 minute, you gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) on attacks made with the weapon. The type of damage is based on the element you chose: lightning or thunder (air), acid (earth), fire (fire), or cold (water). While your weapon is imbued with an element, you can choose to deal its damage type instead of radiant damage when you use your Divine Smite.\n  You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\n\n##### Aura of Resistance\nBeginning at 7th level, your power over the elements forms a magical ward around you. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage when you finish a short or long rest. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage of this type. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Elemental Companion\nAt 15th level, you can call upon the service of an elemental companion to aid you on your quests. As an action, you can summon an elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any verbal commands you issue to it. If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. It rolls its own initiative and has its own turns in combat.\n  You can have only one elemental companion at a time. If you summon a new one, the previous one disappears. In addition, you can't have a creature magically bound to you or your service, such as through the *conjure elemental* or *dominate person* spells or similar magic, while you have an elemental companion, but you can still have the willing service of a creature that isn't magically bound to you.\n  The elemental continues to serve you until you dismiss it as a bonus action or it is reduced to 0 hit points, which causes it to disappear. Once you summon an elemental companion, you can't summon another one until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Elemental Champion\nAt 20th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest the unchained power of the elements. Your eyes glow with fire, your hair and clothes move as if blown by a strong wind, droplets of rain float in a watery halo around you, and the ground trembles with your every step. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: \n* You gain the flying speed of an air elemental (90 feet with hover), the Earth Glide trait and burrowing speed of an earth elemental (30 feet), or the swimming speed of a water elemental (90 feet). \n* You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage. \n* Any weapon you hold is imbued with the power of the elements. Choose an element, as with Elemental Strike. Your weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage to any creature you hit. The type of damage is based on the element you chose: lightning or thunder (air), acid (earth), fire (fire), or cold (water). While your weapon is imbued with an element, you can choose to deal its damage type in place of radiant damage when you use your Divine Smite.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Taking the mantle of a guardian is a solemn vow to place the needs of the many before the needs of yourself and requires constant vigilance.\n\n##### Tenets of the Guardian\nWhen you take this oath, you always do so with a particular group, town, region, or government in mind, pledging to protect them.\n\n***Encourage Prosperity.*** You must work hard to bring joy and prosperity to all around you.\n\n***Preserve Order.*** Order must be protected and preserved for all to enjoy. You must work to keep treasured people, objects, and communities safe.\n\n***Decisive Action.*** Threats to peaceful life are often nefarious and subtle. The actions you take to combat such threats should not be.\n\n##### Oath Spells\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Guardian Spells table.

See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\n\n***Inspired Leadership.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to inspire your allies with your faith. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). For 1 minute, each target has advantage on Strength, Constitution, and Charisma saving throws.\n\n ***Turn the Wild.*** As an action, you can cause wild creatures to flee from your presence using your Channel Divinity. Each creature within 30 feet of you with an Intelligence score of 4 or less that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\n  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\n\n##### Aura of Awareness\nStarting at 7th level, allies around you are more alert and ready to act. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, you and any of your companions within 10 feet of you can't be surprised except when incapacitated. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Hold the Line\nAt 15th level, you can turn an ally's success into an opportunity. When a friendly creature you can see within 20 feet of you is forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to the target's saving throw. If the saving throw is successful, the target can make one weapon attack against the attacker as a reaction, provided the attacker is within the weapon's range.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Band of Heroes\nAt 20th level, you can charge your allies with divine heroism. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to your proficiency bonus, which can include yourself. Each target gains the following benefits for 1 minute: \n* The target is cured of all disease and poison and can't be frightened or poisoned. \n* The target has advantage on Wisdom and Constitution saving throws. \n* The target gains temporary hit points equal to your level.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Ironically, paladins who follow this oath remain far from home in pursuit of their goals. Their oath reflects the welcoming warmth and light provided by the hearth, and paladins following the oath use these elements to turn away the cold or defeat enemies who employ cold as weapons.\n\n##### Tenets of the Hearth\nPaladins who take the Oath of the Hearth accommodate all creatures and attempt to find diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Once engaged in battle, though, these paladins fight until they defeat their enemies, or their enemies surrender. They rarely extend this peaceful stance to creatures who attack with cold or desire to spread cold conditions beyond natural confines.\n\n***Bastion of Peace.*** Reach out the hand of friendship when encountering strangers, and advocate for peace at the outset of any meeting. Encourage your companions to do likewise. When it becomes clear your opponents wish for violence, don't shrink away from combat.\n\n ***Beacon in the Dark.*** When winter comes and the nights increasingly lengthen, shine a welcoming light to which all people can rally. No creature shall prey on others under the cover of darkness while you are there.\n\n ***Hospitality of Home.*** Provide the comforts of home to those who meet with you peacefully. Respect others' cultures and traditions, provided they don't espouse aggression and violence toward others.\n\n ***Protection from the Elements.*** Ensure all people have shelter from the weather. Help during spring flooding, wintry blizzards, and when the blistering sun threatens heatstroke in the summer.\n\n ***Repel the Cold.*** Strive against foes that seek to bring eternal winter to the world or expand their icy domains into warmer climates. Understand the necessity of the changing of seasons and seek to banish only cold that is abnormal.\n\n##### Divine Sense\nIn addition to knowing the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead, your Divine Sense feature allows you to know the location of any cold creature within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover.\n\n##### Fiery Smite\nWhen you use your Divine Smite feature, you can choose for the extra damage you deal to be fire or radiant, and the extra damage increases to 1d8 only if the target is an undead or a cold creature.\n\n##### Oath Spells\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of the Hearth Spells table.

See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.\n\n ***Cease Hostility.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak soothing words. For 1 minute, each creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to attack another creature. A creature hostile to you has disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect ends on a creature if it is attacked or harmed by a spell.\n\n ***Turn Boreal Creatures.*** As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak a prayer against unnatural cold. Each cold creature within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\n  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\n\n##### Aura of the Hearth\nBeginning at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal cold damage. If such a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or effect that allows the creature to take only half the cold damage on a successful save, the creature instead takes no damage. In addition, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against the longterm effects of exposure to cold weather. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Icewalker\nStarting at 15th level, you have resistance to cold damage, and you can't be restrained or petrified by cold or ice. In addition, you can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.\n\n##### Roaring Fire\nAt 20th level, you can take on the aspects of a healthy, tended fire, radiating heat and light. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: \n* You shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. \n* Whenever a cold creature starts its turn within 20 feet of you, the creature takes 2d8 fire damage, which ignores resistance and immunity to fire damage. \n* Whenever you cast a paladin spell that deals fire damage and has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it as a bonus action instead. \n* Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. If you deal fire damage to a cold creature, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute, or until it takes any damage.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

You pledged that you would do anything asked of you, if only you would be spared this fate worse than death.\n  That prayer was answered. The source of that answered prayer is not known, but its power flowed through you, helping you drive off the horrible unlife that was your fate. That power flows through you still. It drives you to defend innocents from the scourge of undeath, and it provides special powers for you to use in that fight.\n\n##### Restriction: Non-Darakhul\nYou can choose this paladin sacred oath only if you are not a darakhul.\n\n##### Tenets of the Plaguetouched\nPaladins following the Oath of the Plaguetouched share these tenets.\n\n ***Bravery.*** In the face of terrible creatures, you stand like a wall between them and the innocent people whom those creatures would devour or transform.\n\n ***Stop the Spread of Undeath.*** Fight to ensure the undead don't snuff out the light of life in the world.\n\n ***Relentless.*** Creatures of undeath never tire; you must remain vigilant.\n\n ***Mercy.*** Those who suffer disease must be cared for.

For 1 minute, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, each hostile creature within 5 feet of you has disadvantage on its first attack roll each turn that isn't against you. If the hostile creature is undead, it instead has disadvantage on all attack rolls that aren't against you. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\n\n ***Turn Undead.*** As an action, you present your holy symbol and call upon your power, using your Channel Divinity. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\n  A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.

In addition, when you or a friendly creature hit an undead creature within 10 feet of you with a melee weapon attack, the attacker can choose if the attack deals radiant damage or its normal type of damage. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Bulwark Against Death and Disease\nStarting at 15th level, you can expend only 1 hit point from your lay on hands pool to cure the target of a disease. In addition, your hit point maximum can't be reduced, and you have advantage on saving throws against effects from undead creatures that reduce your ability scores, such as a shadow's Strength Drain.\n\n##### Scourge of Undeath\nAt 20th level, as a bonus action, you can become a scourge to undead. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits: \n* The bright light shed by your Protective Aura is sunlight. \n* You have advantage on attack rolls against undead. \n* An undead creature in your Aura of Radiant Energy takes extra radiant damage equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) when you or a friendly creature hit it with a melee weapon attack.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms. \n \n##### Tenets of Devotion \n \nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets. \n \n**_Honesty._** Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise. \n \n**_Courage._** Never fear to act, though caution is wise. \n \n**_Compassion._** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom. \n \n**_Honor._** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm. \n \n**_Duty._** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you. \n \n##### Oath Spells \n \nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed. \n \n | Level | Paladin Spells                           | \n|-------|------------------------------------------| \n| 3rd   | protection from evil and good, sanctuary | \n| 5th   | lesser restoration, zone of truth        | \n| 9th   | beacon of hope, dispel magic             | \n| 13th  | freedom of movement, guardian of faith   | \n| 17th  | commune, flame strike                    | \n \n##### Channel Divinity \n \nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. \n \n**_Sacred Weapon._** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. \n \nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends. \n \n**_Turn the Unholy._** As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. \n \nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.

For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. \n \nWhenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. \n \nIn addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by fiends or undead. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

For instance, you may still demand a fair fight against a worthy adversary, but show only contempt to those you deem weak.\n\n**_Utter Depravity._** You follow some part of your former oath to the opposite extreme. If you were once honest to a fault, you might now tell lies for the simple pleasure of causing others pain.\n\n**_Misguided Revenge._** You blame your fall not on your own failings but on the actions of another, possibly one who remained righteous where you wavered.

If the target creature fails a Wisdom saving throw against your spellcasting DC, it is compelled to obey you for the next 24 hours. The effect ends on the target creature if you use this ability on a different target, and you cannot use this ability on an undead creature if its challenge rating exceeds or is equal to your paladin class level.\n\n**_Frightful Bearing._** As an action, you take on a menacing aspect to terrify your enemies. You target any number of creatures within 30 feet that can see you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Each target that fails its save becomes frightened of you. The creature remains frightened for 1 minute, but it may make a new Wisdom saving throw to end the effect if it is more than 30 feet away from you at the end of its turn.\n\n##### Aura of Loathing\n\nStarting at 7th level, you add your Charisma modifier to damage rolls from melee weapons (with a minimum bonus of +1). Creatures of the fiend or undead type within 10 feet of you also gain this bonus, but the bonus does not stack with the same bonus from another paladin.\n\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\n\n##### Unearthly Barrier\n\nBeginning at 15th level, you receive resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n##### Master of Doom\n\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can cloak yourself and any allied creatures of your choice within 30-feet in an aura of darkness. For 1 minute, bright light in this radius becomes dim light, and any creatures that use primarily sight suffer disadvantage on attack rolls against you and the others cloaked by you.\n\nIf an enemy that starts its turn in the aura is frightened of you, it suffers 4d10 psychic damage. You may also use a bonus action to lash out with malicious energy against one creature on your turn during the duration of the aura.

            "desc": "### Divine Sense \n \nThe presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire \n \nCount Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the *hallow* spell. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses. \n \n### Lay on Hands \n \nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level \u00d7 5. \n \nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. \n \nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one. \n \nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs. \n \n### Fighting Style \n \nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Great Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. \n \n#### Protection \n \nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. \n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells. \n \n### Divine Smite \n \nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend. \n \n### Divine Health \n \nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.\n\n ### Sacred Oath \n\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature. \n \n#### Oath Spells \n \nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. \n \nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you. \n \n#### Channel Divinity \n \nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. \n \nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. \n \nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.\n\n>### Breaking Your Oath \n>\n> A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. \n> \n> A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. \n> \n> If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.\n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Aura of Protection \n \nStarting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus. \n \nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n \n### Aura of Courage \n \nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be frightened while you are conscious. \n \nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet. \n \n### Improved Divine Smite \n \nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite. \n \n### Cleansing Touch \n \nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch. \n \nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. \n \n### Sacred Oaths \n \nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.",

                    "desc": "People have used animals in their war efforts since time immemorial. As a beast trainer, you teach animals how to fight and survive on the battlefield. You also train them to recognize and obey your allies when you aren't able to direct them. While a beast trainer can train any type of animal, they often generate a strong bond with one species and focus their training on beasts of that type.\n\n##### Beast Whisperer\nStarting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Animal Handling. If you already have proficiency in this skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it.\n\n##### Trained Animals\nBeginning when you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a beast companion. Choose a beast that is Medium or smaller and has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. The beast is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any commands that you issue to it. In combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. The beast can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics.\n\nIf you are knocked unconscious, killed, or otherwise unable to command your trained animal, one of your allies can use a bonus action to command it by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.\n\nWhen you reach 7th level, you can have more than one trained animal at a time. All your trained animals can have a total challenge rating equal to a quarter of your level, rounded down. A beast with a challenge rating of 0 is considered to have a challenge rating of 1/8 for the purpose of determining the number of trained animals you can have. You can use a bonus action to direct all your trained animals to take the same action, or you can use an action to command all of them to take different actions.\n\nTo have one or more trained animals, you must spend at least one hour each day practicing commands and playing with your animals, which you can do during a long rest.\n\nIf a trained animal dies, you can use an action to touch the animal and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The animal returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.\n\n##### Bestial Flanker\nAt 7th level, when you hit a creature, you can choose one of your trained animals you can see within 30 feet of you. If that trained animal attacks the creature you hit before your next turn, it has advantage on its first attack roll.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Bred for Battle\nStarting at 11th level, add half your proficiency bonus to each trained animal's AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and to any skills in which it is proficient, and increase each trained animal's hit point maximum by twice your proficiency bonus. In addition, you can choose Large and smaller beasts when you select trained animals.\n\n##### Primal Whirlwind\nAt 15th level, when you command your trained animals to use the Attack action, you can choose for one trained animal to attack all creatures within 5 feet of it, making one attack against each creature.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",

In return for their diligent protection, the forests offer their blessings to dedicated alseid rangers. In recent years, woodsy adventurers of other races who have earned the forests' trust also received this blessing, though their numbers are scant. These Grove Wardens can tap into the living magic of ancient forests. Your senses travel through the plants and earth of the woods, and the very land rises up to strike down your enemies.\n\n##### Grove Warden Magic\nStarting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Grove Warden Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.\n\n**Grove Warden Spells**\n| Ranger Level  | Spells                  | \n|---------------|-------------------------| \n| 3rd           | *entangle*              | \n| 5th           | *branding smite*        | \n| 9th           | *speak with plants*     | \n| 13th          | *hallucinatory terrain* | \n| 17th          | *animate objects*       |\n\n##### Whispers of the Forest\nAt 3rd level, when you use your Primeval Awareness feature while within a forest, you add humanoids to the list of creature types you can sense. When sensing humanoids, you know the general direction of the creatures, and you know if a humanoid is solitary, in a small group of up to 5 humanoids, or a pack of more than 5 humanoids.\n\n##### Forest's Will\nAt 3rd level, you can magically draw on the living essence of the land to hamper your foes. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your next weapon attack against that creature has advantage. If that attack hits, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. When you reach 11th level in this class, if that attack hits, the creature's speed is instead halved until the start of your next turn.\n\n##### Intruder's Bane\nAt 7th level, you can command the land around you to come to your aid. As a bonus action, choose a point you can see on the ground within 60 feet. You cause the area within 15 feet of that point to undulate and warp. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature is pushed up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice and knocked prone. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Wrath of the Forest\nAt 11th level, you can call on the land in your vicinity to strike at your enemies. When you take the Attack action, you can use a bonus action to make a rock, branch, root, or other small natural object attack a creature within 30 feet of you. You are proficient with the attack, it counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and you add your Dexterity modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage is of a type appropriate to the object, such as piercing for a thorny branch or bludgeoning for a rock, and the damage die is a d8.\n\n##### Living Bulwark\nStarting at 15th level, the land around you comes to your aid when you are in danger, interposing rocks, branches, vines, roots, or even the ground itself between you and your foes. When a creature you can see targets you with an attack, you can use your reaction to roll a d8 and add it to your AC against the attack.",

Haunted wardens are rangers who have come face to face with the restless spirit of one of those lost wanderers. Somehow during the course of this meeting, the yearning phantom tethers its spirit to the warden's in order to put its unfinished business to rest. Even after its final wishes are met, or in the tragic instance they can't come to fruition, your companion remains with you until you meet your end, both as a constant confidante and a reminder that the veil between life and death is thin indeed.\n\n##### Beyond the Pale\nStarting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to see into the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Haunted Warden Magic\nYou learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Haunted Warden Spells table.

The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See the spirit's game statistics in the Spirit Usher stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.\n\nYou determine the spirit's appearance, name, and personality. You should choose a personality trait, ideal, bond, and flaw for it, and you should work with your GM to decide on a background story for the spirit that fits the campaign.\n  In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n  When it joins with you, the spirit learns three cantrips it can cast at will, which you select from the following lists. At the end of a long rest, you can change which cantrips the spirit knows. \n* Choose one of *chill touch*, *ray of frost*, *sacred flame*, or *vicious mockery*. Use your level when determining the damage of the chosen cantrip. \n* Choose one of *druidcraft*, *prestidigitation*, or *thaumaturgy*. \n* Choose one of *dancing lights*, *message*, or *minor illusion*.\nThe spirit is bonded to you. It can't be turned or destroyed, such as with the cleric's Turn Undead feature. When the spirit usher dies, it retreats to the Ethereal Plane to restore itself and returns to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you when you finish a long rest. If the spirit usher died within the last hour, you can use your action to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to return it to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.\n\n##### Merge Spirit\nStarting at 7th level, you can use an action to cause your spirit usher to join its essence with you for 1 minute. While merged, you gain the spirit usher's Ethereal Sight trait and can interact with creatures and objects on both the Ethereal and Material Planes. In addition, while you are merged, you become less substantial and gain the spirit usher's damage resistances and damage immunities.\n  Once you use this feature, you shouldn't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Each time you use it again, you suffer one level of exhaustion.\n\n##### Guardian Geist\nAt 11th level, when you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to call out to your spirit usher. If you do, your spirit usher teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and takes half the damage dealt to you, potentially preventing your death.\n  In addition, when your spirit usher dies, you have advantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn.\n\n##### True Psychopomp\nAt 15th level, you can use your Merge Sprit feature as a bonus action instead of an action. When you and your spirit usher merge forms, you gain its Incorporeal Movement trait and Etherealness action, and you are considered to be undead for the purposes of determining whether or not spells or other magical effects can affect you.",

Snakes are common throughout the world, and people who need to travel through snake-filled jungles often retain a snake speaker guide, trusting the guide to protect them from scaly poisoners.\n\n##### Snake Speaker Magic\nStarting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Snake Speaker Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.\n\n**Snake Speaker Spells**\n| Ranger Level  | Spells            | \n|---------------|-------------------| \n| 3rd           | *charm person*    | \n| 5th           | *suggestion*      | \n| 9th           | *tongues*         | \n| 13th          | *confusion*       | \n| 17th          | *dominate person* |\n\n##### Scaly Transition\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can take on limited serpentine aspects. When you finish a long rest, select one of the following features. You gain the benefit of the chosen feature until the next time you finish a long rest. Starting at 11th level, you can select two options when you finish a long rest.\n\n***Bite.*** You develop venomous fangs. When you use the Attack action and attack with a weapon, you can use a bonus action to bite a target within 5 feet of you with your fangs. You are proficient with the fangs, which deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) plus 1d8 poison damage on a hit.\n\n***Keen Smell.*** Your nose and olfactory organs change to resemble those belonging to a snake. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on scent and on Wisdom (Insight) checks.\n\n***Poison Resistance.*** You have resistance to poison damage.\n\n***Scales.*** Scales sprout along your body. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\n\n***Serpentine Movement.*** You have a climbing speed of 30 feet.\n\n##### Speak with Snakes\nStarting at 3rd level, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with snakes. A snake's knowledge and awareness are limited by its Intelligence, but it can give you information about things it has perceived within the last day. You can persuade a snake to perform small favors for you, such as carrying a written message to a nearby companion.\n\n##### Serpent Shape\nWhen you reach 7th level, you can use an action to cast *polymorph* on yourself, assuming the shape of a giant constrictor snake, flying snake, or giant poisonous snake. While you are in the form of a snake, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n  Starting at 15th level, you retain the benefits of your Scaly Transition feature while in the form of a snake, and you can use this feature twice between rests.\n\n##### Sinuous Dance\nBeginning at 11th level, your physical movements can beguile your enemies and strengthen your magic. You can choose to use Dexterity as your spellcasting ability score instead of Wisdom.\n  In addition, when you cast a spell, you can add your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers together and use the result as your spellcasting ability modifier when determining the DC or spell attack bonus for that spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Decoy Skin\nStarting at 15th level, you learn to magically shed your skin and use it as an animate decoy. As an action, you can shed your skin, which creates a duplicate of yourself. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. It looks like you, has your Armor Class and saving throw bonuses, and has hit points equal to three times your ranger level. It lasts for 10 minutes or until it is reduced to 0 hit points.\n  As a bonus action, you can command it to move up to your speed, using any form of movement you possess, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. Your decoy can't take actions or use your class features, but it otherwise moves as directed. While your decoy is within 5 feet of you, its appearance and movements so closely mimic yours that when a creature that can reach you and your decoy makes an attack against you, it has a 50 percent change of hitting your decoy instead.\n  It looks exactly as you looked when you used this feature, and it is a convincing duplicate of you. A creature can discern that it isn't you with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

These warriors can make a dizzying variety of ranged and melee attacks in quick succession, using ancient magic to flash across the battlefield.\n\n##### Restriction: Alseid\nYou can choose this archetype only if you are an alseid.\n\n##### Weald Spear\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to call forth a magical, wooden spear from the land of fey into your empty hand as a bonus action. The spear disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You are proficient with the weapon while you wield it. The spear's range is 20/60 feet, and, when you throw the spear, it reappears in your hand after the attack. The spear's damage die is a d8, and it has the finesse and reach properties.\n  At 7th level, your weald spear attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and your weald spear's damage die is a d10. At 11th level, your weald spear's damage die is a d12.\n\n##### Touch of the Fey Land\nThe touch of the land of the fey is always on your spear, hinting at its otherworldly ties. Beginning at 3rd level, when you summon your weald spear, choose one of the following effects.\n\n***Aflame.*** Your spear is ensorcelled in heatless, white, magical flames whose intensity rise and fall to reflect your mood. When you are at your happiest, your spear sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\n\n***Entwined.*** Your spear appears to be wrapped in writhing green vines which occasionally coalesce into the shape of a slender, grasping hand. The hand always points in the direction of your home forest.\n\n***Everblooming.*** Your spear is covered in small wildflowers that bloom, die, bud, and bloom again within minutes. Pollinating insects are often drawn to your spear as the spear constantly exudes a pleasant, floral fragrance.\n\n***Moonlit.*** Your spear appears as a pale length of wooden moonlight. A trail of star-like motes travels behind the spear's point.\n\n##### Canopy\nBeginning at 7th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you, including yourself, is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to summon a magical canopy of glowing leaves and branches over the target. The target has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack, and the canopy bursts into shredded leaves afterwards. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Canopy again.\n  When you reach 11th level in this class, you can use your Canopy twice between rests, and at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses.\n\n##### Steps of the Forest God\n Starting at 11th level, after you make a successful ranged weapon attack with your weald spear, you can use a bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of your target.\n\n##### Overwhelm\nAt 15th level, after you make a successful melee weapon attack with your weald spear against a creature, you can use a bonus action to make one ranged weapon attack with it against a different creature. You don't have disadvantage on the ranged attack roll from being within 5 feet of the first creature you hit, however, you can still have disadvantage on the attack roll from being within 5 feet of other creatures.",

You can use a bonus action to imbue your weapon with chaotic energy for 1 minute. Roll a d8 and consult the Chaotic Strikes table to determine which type of energy is imbued in your weapon.

You can use an action to summon a fiend or aberration with a challenge rating of 2 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. It disappears after 1 hour, when you are incapacitated, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.\n  The otherworldly being is friendly to you and your companions. In combat, roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the otherworldly being, it attacks the creature you are attacking, or defends itself from hostile creatures if you aren't attacking a creature, but otherwise takes no actions.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 17th level in this class, you can summon a fiend or aberration with a challenge rating of 5 or lower with this feature.\n\n##### Dimensional Step\nAt 15th level, you have learned to slip briefly between worlds.

            "desc": "### Favored Enemy \n \nBeginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy. \n \nChoose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. \n \nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. \n \nWhen you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all. \n \nYou choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures. \n \n### Natural Explorer \n \nYou are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in. \n \nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits: \n* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel. \n* Your group can't become lost except by magical means. \n* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. \n* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. \n* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. \n* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area. \n \nYou choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level. \n \n### Fighting Style \n \nAt 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. \n \n#### Archery \n \nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. \n \n#### Defense \n \nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. \n \n#### Dueling \n \nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. \n \n#### Two-Weapon Fighting \n \nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. \n \n### Spellcasting \n \nBy the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier \n \n### Ranger Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. \n \n### Primeval Awareness \n \nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Extra Attack \n \nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n### Land's Stride \n \nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. \n \nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the *entangle* spell. \n \n### Hide in Plain Sight \n \nStarting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage. \n \nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit. \n \n### Vanish \n \nStarting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail. \n \n### Feral Senses \n \nAt 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. \n \nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened. \n \n### Foe Slayer \n \nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.",

                    "desc": "As a cat burglar, you've honed your ability to enter closed or restricted areas, drawing upon a tradition first developed among the catfolk, who often are innately curious and driven to learn what wonders, riches, or unusual friends and foes lie beyond their reach or just out of sight. In ages past, some allowed this inquisitiveness to guide them toward a rogue's life devoted to bridging that gap by breaking into any and all structures, dungeons, or walled-off regions that prevented them from satisfying their curiosity.\n\nSo successful were these first catfolk burglars that other rogues soon began emulating their techniques. Walls become but minor inconveniences once you work out the best methods of scaling them and learn to mitigate injuries from falls. In time, cat burglars become adept at breaching any openings they find; after all, if a door was not meant to be opened, why would it have been placed there? Those who devote a lifetime to such endeavors eventually learn to spot and bypass even the cleverest traps and hidden doors, including those disguised or warded by magic.\n\nSome cat burglars use their abilities to help themselves to the contents of treasure vaults or uncover hidden secrets, others become an integral part of an adventuring party that values skillful infiltration techniques, and still others get the jump on their foes by taking the fight to them where and when they least expect it, up to and including private bed chambers or inner sanctums. You'll likely end up someplace you're not supposed to be, but those are the places most worth visiting!\n\n##### Up, Over, and In\nBeginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. If you already have a climbing speed equal to or greater than your walking speed, it increases by 5 feet. In addition, when you are falling, you can use your reaction to soften the fall. You reduce the falling damage you take by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus + your rogue level. You don't land prone, unless the damage you take from the fall would reduce you to less than half your hit point maximum.\n\n##### Artful Dodger\nAt 3rd level, alert to the dangers posed by hidden traps and wards, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist a trap or a magic effect with a trigger, such as the *glyph of warding* spell, and you have resistance to the damage dealt by such effects.\n\n##### Cat's Eye\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to find or disarm traps, locate secret or hidden doors, discern the existence of an illusion, or spot a *glyph of warding*. You can also search for traps while traveling at a normal pace, instead of only while at a slow pace.\n\n##### Breaking and Entering\nAt 13th level, when you make an attack against a door, gate, window, shutters, bars, or similar object or structure that is blocking or barring an egress, you have advantage on the attack roll, and you can add your Sneak Attack damage on a hit. You can choose for this damage to be audible out to a range of 100 feet or to be audible only within 5 feet of the point where you hit the object or structure. Similarly, you can choose for this damage to appear more or less impactful than it actually is, such as neatly carving a hole for you to squeeze through a wall or window or bursting a door off its hinges.\n\nYour expertise at deftly dismantling crafted works extends to constructs and undead. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack feature against constructs and undead. As normal, you can't use Sneak Attack if you have disadvantage on the attack roll.\n\n##### Master Burglar\nAt 17th level, you can slip past a fire-breathing statue unscathed or tread lightly enough to not set off a pressure plate. The first time on each of your turns 118 that you would trigger a trap or magic effect with a trigger, such as the *glyph of warding* spell, you can choose to not trigger it.\n  As a bonus action, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you can see within 30 feet of you and grant them the effects of this feature for 1 hour. Once you grant this feature to others, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.",

Dawn blades are devout rogues, drawing divine power from deities of light to strike as a sudden ray of searing sunlight in the darkness. They are often considered controversial by other adherents of their faith, yet the faith's leadership understands such agents are sometimes necessary.\n\n##### Eyes of the Dawn\nAt 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet.\n\n##### Dawn Strike\nStarting at 3rd level, when you deal damage with your Sneak Attack feature, you can magically change the extra damage dealt to radiant damage. When you hit an undead or a creature of shadow with such a Sneak Attack, you deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage.\n\n##### Radiant Beam\nBeginning at 3rd level, when you deal radiant damage to a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to throw a portion of that radiant energy at a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged weapon attack against the second creature. You are proficient with this beam, and you don't have disadvantage on the ranged attack roll from being within 5 feet of the first creature (though you can still have disadvantage from other sources). On a hit, the beam deals 1d6 radiant damage.\n  When you reach 10th level in this class, the beam's damage increases to 2d6.\n\n##### Bolstering Light\nStarting at 9th level, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with radiant damage, choose one of the following: \n* Gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rogue level for 1 hour. \n* End one condition affecting you. The condition can be blinded, deafened, or poisoned. \n* End one curse affecting you. \n* End one disease affecting you.\n\n##### Sudden Illumination\nAt 13th level, when you hit a creature with your Radiant Beam, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) or be blinded until the end of its next turn.\n\n##### Dawn Flare\nAt 17th level, when you use your Dawn Strike feature to deal radiant damage to a creature that can't see you, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 radiant damage and can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Once a creature takes damage from this feature, it is immune to your Dawn Flare for 24 hours.",

                    "desc": "You focus as much on identifying the weak points of structures as on the weak points of creatures. Sappers are deployed with the soldiery to dig trenches, build bridges, and breach defenses. When troops move into a heavily defended area, it's your job to make it happen as efficiently as possible.\n\n##### Combat Engineer\nWhen you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in alchemist's supplies, carpenter's tools, mason's tools, and tinker's tools. Using these tools, you can do or create the following.\n\n***Alchemical Bomb.*** As an action, you can mix together volatile chemicals into an explosive compound and throw it at a point you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking 1d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Alchemical bombs lose their potency and become inert 1 minute after they are created.\n  If a construct fails the saving throw or if you throw the bomb at a structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried, your bomb also deals your Sneak Attack damage to the target.\n  When you reach certain levels in this class, the bomb's damage increases: at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).\n\n***Jury Rig Fortification.*** You are adept at creating fortifications with whatever materials are at hand. With 1 minute of work, you can create one of the following. Your ability to use this option might be limited by the available building materials or if the ground is too hard to work, at the GM's discretion. \n* Create a low wall that is large enough to provide half cover to a Medium creature. \n* Dig a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide trench to a depth of 3 feet. \n* Build a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide ladder. Each additional minute spent on this option increases the length of the ladder by 5 feet. The ladder is sturdy enough to be used as a bridge.\n\n***Hastily Trap an Area.*** You can create and set some types of traps quickly. The Creating Traps table indicates the timeframes required to build and deploy commonly used traps. At the GM's discretion, you can use this feature to make and use other types of traps.\n\n**Creating Traps (table)**\n| Type of Trap        | Time Required to Build Trap                             | Time Required to Set Trap              | \n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------| \n| **Collapsing Roof** | 5 minutes for each 5-foot-by-5-foot section             | When you finish building this trap, it is considered set. | \n| **Falling Net**     | 1 minute                                                | 1 action                               | \n| **Hunting Trap**    | 1 minute                                                | 1 bonus action                         | \n| **Pit**             | 5 minutes for a 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep simple pit<br/>15 minutes for a 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep hidden pit<br/>1 hour for a 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep locking pit;<br/>to add spikes to a pit, increase the time by 1 minute.     | When you finish building this trap, it is considered set.<br/>It requires 1 bonus action to reset a simple pit or locking pit<br/>1 action to reset a hidden pit.|\n\n##### Sculpt Terrain\nAt 3rd level, when you throw your alchemical bomb, you can choose for the bomb to not deal damage. If you do so, the area within 10 feet of the point of impact becomes difficult terrain. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature, if the creature is within the difficult terrain created by your alchemical bomb.\n\n##### Breach Defenses\nStarting at 9th level, when you hit a structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried, your attack treats the structure or object as if its damage threshold is 5 lower. For example, if you hit a door that has a damage threshold of 10, its damage threshold is considered 5 when determining if your attack's damage meets or exceeds its threshold. If a structure or object doesn't have a damage threshold or if this feature would allow you to treat its damage threshold as 0 or lower, your attack also deals your Sneak Attack damage to the target.\n  When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage threshold your attacks can ignore increases: at 13th level (10) and 17th level (15).\n\n##### Clear the Path\nAt 13th level, you have advantage on checks to disarm traps. If you fail a check made to disarm a trap, the trap doesn't trigger even if its description states otherwise. In addition, you can disarm a trap as a bonus action.\n\n##### All Clear\nBeginning at 17th level, you can use an action to declare a 50-foot-square area safe for travel for 1 minute. Mechanical and magical traps in the area don't trigger for the duration. In addition, difficult terrain in the area doesn't cost you or any creatures you designate who can see or hear you extra movement when moving through it. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

Exotic poisons from far-off locales, banned or cursed magic items, and illicit drugs or bootleg liquor all fetch a high price on the black market. Thieves- guilds, pirates, and criminal kingpins pay well to those who can avoid law enforcement when moving stolen goods, provide safe channels of communication, break associates free from jail cells or dungeons, or deliver supplies past guards. You-ve become adept at all of these things, perhaps even having developed a network of contacts as a criminal, noble, con artist, or sailor during an earlier part of your life.\n\n##### Dab-handed Dealer\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with vehicles (land and water) and with your choice of either the disguise kit or navigator-s tools. Moreover, when determining your carrying capacity, you are considered one size category larger than your actual size.\n  Starting at this level, you also have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to hide objects on vehicles, and you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a check to control a vehicle, or to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to conceal a light weapon on yourself, opposed by the Wisdom (Perception) checks of creatures within 5 feet of you; if you succeed on a check to conceal a weapon in this way, then you have advantage on your next attack against one of those creatures using that weapon, including on ranged attacks even if the target is within 5 feet of you.\n\n##### Smuggler-s Legerdemain\nAlso at 3rd level, having made a careful study of laws and those who enforce them, you-ve become adept at avoiding both, even mastering a handful of arcane techniques that aid your smuggling activities. You learn two cantrips at this level and, when you reach 7th level in this class, one 1st-level spell of your choice. The cantrips and spell must be from among the illusion or transmutation spells on the wizard spell list, all of which are ideally suited for manipulating goods, duping guards, communicating with covert contacts, or escaping from a failed heist. Having learned these forms of magic through research and rote memorization, Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.\n  You can cast the cantrips at will and the spell once at its lowest level; you must finish a long rest before casting the spell again in this way. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.\n  Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace the 1st-level spell with another 1st-level spell of your choice from among the illusion or transmutation spells on the wizard spell list.\n\n##### Hypervigilance\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or hearing, and you can-t be surprised while you are conscious. In addition, you have developed an awareness for avoiding social or legal entrapment, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to discern loopholes and traps in legal documents and on Wisdom (Insight) checks to discern when you are being manipulated into a bad social or legal situation.\n\n##### Improved Smuggler-s Legerdemain\nAt 13th level, to further facilitate your extralegal activities, you learn a second illusion or transmutation spell, which must be one of the following: *arcanist-s magic aura*, *blur*, *darkvision*, *enlarge/reduce*, *invisibility*, *knock*, *levitate*, *magic mouth*, *mirror image*, *rope trick*, or *spider climb*. Intelligence is again your spellcasting ability for this spell. You can cast this spell once at its lowest level and must finish a long rest before you can cast it again in this way. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd-level or higher. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace a spell from this list with another from this list.\n  In addition, beginning at 13th level, whenever you cast one of your 1st-level Smuggler-s Legerdemain spells, you always cast it as if using a 2nd-level spell slot unless you choose to cast it using a spell slot you have of a different level.\n\n##### Slippery as an Eel\nStarting at 17th level, you have become especially adept at slipping away from the authorities and getting a jump on foes, even when encumbered by illicit goods. Your speed increases by 10 feet, you ignore difficult terrain, and you have advantage on initiative rolls.",

Occasionally, they aid other agents of their deities, but most often they locate and manage or eliminate threats to their deities that more scrupulous agents might be unwilling or unable to handle.\n\n##### Spellcasting\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells drawn from the magic of a divine entity.\n\n##### Cantrips\nYou learn three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn another cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.\n\n**Soulspy Spellcasting**\n| Rouge Level  | Cantrips Known | Spells Known | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | \n|--------------|----------------|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----| \n| 3rd          | 3              | 3              | 2   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 4th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 5th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 6th          | 3              | 4              | 3   | -   | -   | -   | \n| 7th          | 3              | 5              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \n| 8th          | 3              | 6              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \n| 9th          | 3              | 6              | 4   | 2   | -   | -   | \n| 10th         | 4              | 7              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \n| 11th         | 4              | 8              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \n| 12th         | 4              | 8              | 4   | 3   | -   | -   | \n| 13th         | 4              | 9              | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \n| 14th         | 4              | 10             | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \n| 15th         | 4              | 10             | 4   | 3   | 2   | -   | \n| 16th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \n| 17th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \n| 18th         | 4              | 11             | 4   | 3   | 3   | -   | \n| 19th         | 4              | 12             | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   | \n| 20th         | 4              | 13             | 4   | 3   | 3   | 1   |\n\n##### Spell Slots\nThe Soulspy Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend one of these slots at the spell-s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *inflict wounds* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *inflict wounds* using either slot.\n\n##### Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher\nYou know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and necromancy spells on the cleric spell list. The Spells Known column of the Soulspy Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or necromancy spell and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can be from any school of magic.\n  When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cleric spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or necromancy spell, unless you-re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.\n\n##### Spellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You learn your spells through meditation and prayer to the powerful forces that guide your actions. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\n##### Bonus Proficiency\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Religion skill, if you don-t already have it. \n\n##### Divine Symbol\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use an action to create a symbol of your deity that hovers within 5 feet of you. The symbol is a Tiny object that is visible but invulnerable and intangible, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or until you dismiss it (no action required). While this symbol is active, you gain the following benefits: \n* Your Divine Symbol functions as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells. \n* As a bonus action, you can turn the symbol into thieves- tools, which you can use to pick locks, disarm traps, or any other activities that would normally require such tools. While your Divine Symbol is functioning in this way, it loses all other properties listed here. You can change it from thieves- tools back to its symbol form as a bonus action. \n* The symbol sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus action. When you extinguish the symbol-s light, you can also snuff out one candle, torch, or other nonmagical light source within 10 feet of you. \n* When you create this symbol, and as an action on each of your turns while the symbol is active, you can force the symbol to shoot divine energy at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you reach certain levels in this class, the symbol-s damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\n\n##### Sacred Stealth\nStarting at 9th level, you can use your Sneak Attack on a creature hit by an attack with your Divine Symbol if the target of the attack is within 5 feet of an ally, that ally isn-t incapacitated, and you don-t have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Touching the Soul\nWhen you reach 13th level, you can use your Divine Symbol to deliver your cleric spells that have a range of touch. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you as the target of the spell. You can-t use your Sacred Stealth feature on a spell delivered in this way. After you cast the spell, your Divine Symbol ends.\n  In addition, when you cast a spell that deals radiant or necrotic damage, you can switch it to do the other type of damage instead.\n\n##### Life Thief\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to magically channel life force energy out of one creature and into another. When you deal radiant or necrotic damage with your Divine Symbol attack or a cleric spell or cantrip, choose a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to half the radiant or necrotic damage dealt. You can target yourself with this feature. Once you use this feature, you can-t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or fall prone. If the target fails its saving throw, you can make one weapon attack against that target as a bonus action.\n\n##### Death From Below\nBeginning at 13th level, when you move at least 10 feet underground toward a target, your next attack against the target with your *shillelagh* weapon has advantage.\n\n##### Vicious\nAt 17th level, when you use your Death From Below feature and hit the target with your *shillelagh* weapon, the target is restrained by vegetation and soil until the end of its next turn.",

Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ. \n \n##### Fast Hands \n \nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action. \n \n##### Second-Story Work \n \nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement. \n \nIn addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. \n \n##### Supreme Sneak \n \nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn. \n \n##### Use Magic Device \n \nBy 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items. \n \n##### Thief's Reflexes \n \nWhen you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.",

            "desc": "### Expertise \n \nAt 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. \n \nAt 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit. \n \n### Sneak Attack \n \nBeginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon. \n \nYou don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. \n \nThe amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. \n \n### Thieves' Cant \n \nDuring your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. \n \nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. \n \n### Cunning Action \n \nStarting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. \n \n### Roguish Archetype \n \nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Uncanny Dodge \n \nStarting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you. \n \n### Evasion \n \nBeginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an *ice storm* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. \n \n### Reliable Talent \n \nBy 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. \n \n### Blindsense \n \nStarting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you. \n \n### Slippery Mind \n \nBy 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. \n \n### Elusive \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated. \n \n### Stroke of Luck \n \nAt 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. \n \n### Roguish Archetypes \n \nRogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.",

They worked their will upon the land and ocean and created works to show their mastery of the magical arts. Their artistry did not end with the landscape. They also experimented on any warm-blooded creatures they captured until they had warped and molded the creatures into new and deadly forms.\n  One or more of your ancestors was experimented on or an associate of the world's earliest serpentfolk. Your ancestor's natural affinity for magic was nurtured, expanded, and warped by the experimentation of their ophidian masters in order to transform them into something closer to the serpentine ideal. Those alterations made so long ago have waxed in you, allowing you to influence intelligent creatures more easily. Now you must decide if you will follow the serpent's path of dominance and subjugation or if you will fight against their influence and use your power for a greater purpose.\n\n##### Ophidian Metabolism\nAt 1st level, your affinity with serpents grants you a measure of their hardiness. You can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) + your proficiency bonus before you suffer the effects of starvation. You also have advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.\n\n##### Patterned Scales\nAlso at 1st level, when you use magic to trick or deceive, the residual energy of your spell subtly alters how others perceive you. When you cast an illusion spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the duration of the spell and for 10 minutes after the spell's duration ends.\n\n##### Insinuating Serpent\nStarting at 6th level, even when a creature resists your unsettling allure, your presence gets under their skin. When you cast an enchantment or illusion spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, and your target succeeds on its saving throw against your spell, your target becomes charmed by you until the start of your next turn. If the spell you cast affects multiple targets, only one of those targets can be affected by this feature.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spirit Venom\nAt 14th level, you sap the will and resolve of creatures that are under your sway. If you start your turn with at least one creature within 30 feet of you that is currently charmed, frightened, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned by a spell you cast or a magical effect you created, such as from a magic item, you can use your reaction to force each such creature to take 6d4 psychic damage.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have expended all your uses of this feature, you can spend 5 sorcery points at the start of your turn to use it again.\n\n##### Mirrored Lamina\nStarting at 18th level, when you fail a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned by a spell or other magical effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature that cast the spell or created the magical effect to succeed on a saving throw against your spell save DC or suffer the same condition for the same duration.\n  If both you and the creature that targeted you are affected by a condition as a result of this feature and that condition allows for subsequent saving throws to end the effect, the condition ends for both of you if either one of you succeeds on a subsequent saving throw.

Perhaps one of your forebears was marked by the hungering undead. Sorcerers with this origin have an unyielding appetite for arcana and go to nearly any length to satiate their desire to increase their magical power.\n\n##### Hungry Eyes\nAt 1st level, you can sense when a creature is nearing death. You know if a creature you can see that isn't undead or a construct within 30 feet of you is below half its hit point maximum. Your spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover when targeting creatures you sense with this feature.\n\n##### Thirsty Soul\nBeginning at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). This feature can restore you to no more than half your hit point maximum.\n\n##### Feast of Arcana\nStarting at 6th level, when you reduce one or more hostile creatures to 0 hit points with one spell of 1st level or higher, you regain 1 spent sorcery point.\n\n##### Glutton for Punishment\nStarting at 14th level, you can use your reaction to intentionally fail a saving throw against a spell that deals damage and that was cast by a hostile creature. If you do so, you regain a number of spent sorcery points equal to half your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).\n\n##### Greedy Heart\nAt 18th level, when you spend sorcery points to create spell slots or use metamagic, you reduce the cost by 1 sorcery point (this can't reduce the cost below 1).",

Perhaps you endured overexposure to transmutation magic, arcane thunder, or the ear-splitting cries of an androsphinx, bukavac (see *Tome of Beasts*), or avalanche screamer (see *Tome of Beasts 2*). Maybe you can trace your lineage to an ancestor who spent an extended period on a plane dominated by elemental lightning and thunder or by unceasing screams of madness; you yourself may have been born on such a cacophonous plane. Alternately, you or a forebear may have suffered prolonged exposure to the deafening thunderclaps of a bronze dragon's lair. Or you may even have been experimented on by aboleths or other maniacal spellcasters, escaping before the transformation was complete.\u2026\n  Whatever its source, resonant magic infuses your very existence, causing you to manifest one or more unusual characteristics. At your option, you can create a quirk or roll a d6 and consult the Resonant Body Quirks table to determine a quirk for your character.\n\n**Resonant Body Quirks (table)**\n| d6  | Quirk  | \n|---|---------| \n| 1 | You emit a faint hum, audible to any creature within 5 feet of you. | \n| 2 | In response to natural or magical thunder, your body flickers into brief transparency with the sound of each thunderclap | \n| 3 | Beasts with the Keen Hearing trait initially respond aggressively when you come within 30 feet of them. | \n| 4 | If you hold a delicate, nonmagical glass object such as a crystal wine glass for longer than one round, the object shatters. | \n| 5 | Every time you speak, your voice randomly changes in pitch, tone, and/or resonance, so that you never sound quite the same. | \n| 6 | When another living creature touches you, you emit a brief, faint tone like a chime, the volume of which increases with the force of the touch. |\n\n##### Reverberating Quintessence\nAt 1st level, you harbor sonic vibrations within you. You are immune to the deafened condition, and you have tremorsense out to a range of 10 feet. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that deal thunder damage.\n  When you reach 3rd level in this class, you have resistance to thunder damage, and at 6th level, your tremorsense extends to 20 feet.\n\n##### Signature Sound\nStarting at 1st level, you can cast the *alarm* spell (audible option only) once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you cast *alarm* in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\nWhen you reach 3rd level in this class, you can expend 3 sorcery points to cast the *shatter* or *silence* spell without expending a spell slot or requiring material components.\n\n##### Sonic Savant\nBeginning at 6th level, whenever you use a Metamagic option on a spell that deals thunder damage, deafens creatures, or silences or magnifies sounds, you expend only a fraction of your effort to do so. With these sorts of spells, Metamagic options that normally cost only 1 sorcery point instead cost 0 sorcery points; all other Metamagic options cost half the normal number of sorcery points (rounded up).\n  You can use your Sonic Savant feature to reduce the cost of a number of Metamagic options equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Sound and Fury\nAt 14th level, your resistance to thunder damage becomes immunity. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can change the damage type to thunder. If the spell also imposes a condition on a creature damaged by the spell, you can choose to impose the deafened condition instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Resounding Spellcasting\nBeginning when you reach 18th level, any of your cantrips that deal thunder damage affect even those creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a cantrip that deals thunder damage, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\n  Moreover, you can increase the power of some of your spells. When you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st through 5th level that deals thunder damage, you can cause the spell to maximize its damage dice. Once you use this feature, you shouldn't use it again until you finish a long rest. Each time you use it again, you take 2d12 force damage for each level of the spell you cast. This force damage ignores any resistance or immunity to force damage you might have.",

                    "desc": "Rifthoppers are the living embodiment of wanderlust. The yearn to travel and witness unseen vistas burns in them and manifests in their ability to move nearly at the speed of thought. The origin of the rifthoppers' powers remains a mystery, as they refuse to stay in one place long enough to be studied extensively. Given the lack of empirical evidence, many scholars have hypothesized that rifthoppers absorb energy from the world itself, typically through an innate connection with ley lines or with areas where the borders between planes are thin, and can use it to alter their own magic.\n  Adventuring rifthoppers often concern themselves with investigating mysterious portals to unknown locations, researching ley lines and other mystic phenomena, or seeking out and stopping spatial and temporal disturbances.\n\n##### Teleport Object\nStarting at 1st level, you can use an action to teleport a small object that isn't being worn or carried and that you can see within 30 feet of you into your hand. Alternatively, you can teleport an object from your hand to a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The object can weigh no more than 5 pounds and must be able to fit into a 1-foot cube.\n  The weight of the object you can teleport increases when you reach certain levels in this class: at 6th (10 pounds), 14th level (15 pounds), and 18th level (20 pounds).\n\n##### Shift Space\nAt 1st level, once on each of your turns, you can spend an amount of movement equal to up to half your speed and teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within a number of feet equal to the movement you spent. If your speed is 0, such as from being grappled or restrained, you can't use this feature.\n\nWhen you reach 3rd level in this class, you can spend movement equal to your full speed, reducing your speed to 0 for the turn, and expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to teleport yourself to a destination within range. The range you can travel is dependent on the level of the spell slot expended as detailed in the Rifthopper Teleportation Distance table. You bring any objects you are wearing or carrying with you when you teleport, as long as their weight doesn't exceed your carrying capacity. If you teleport into an occupied space, you take 4d6 force damage and are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.\n \n **Rifthopper Teleportation Distance (table)**\n| Spell Slot Level | Distance Teleported | \n|------------------|---------------------| \n| 2nd              | 30 feet             | \n| 3rd              | 60 feet             | \n| 4th              | 120 feet            | \n| 5th              | 240 feet            | \n| 6th              | 480 feet            |\n| 7th or higher    | 960 feet            |\n\n##### Tactical Swap\nAt 6th level, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you starts its turn or when you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is attacked, you can use your reaction to swap positions with the creature. The target must be willing.\n  If you use this feature when you or another creature is attacked, the attack's target becomes the creature that now occupies the space being attacked, not the original target.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Familiar Locations\nStarting at 14th level, if you spend an hour in a location, familiarizing yourself with its features and noting its peculiarities, you can use an action to teleport yourself and a number of willing creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you and that you can see to the location. You can teleport to this location over any distance as long as both you and it are on the same plane of existence. If the location is mobile, such as a boat or wagon, you can't familiarize yourself with it enough to use this feature.\n  You can be familiar with a number of locations equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You can choose to forget a location (no action required) to make room for familiarizing yourself with a new location.\n  You can teleport creatures with this feature a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Dimensional Ambler\nStarting at 18th level, you can use an action to transport yourself and a number of willing creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you and that you can see to the Astral Plane or to the Ethereal Plane. While you are on these planes, you and the creatures you transported can move normally, but each transported creature must stay within 60 feet of you. You can choose to return all of you to the Material Plane at any time as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

                    "desc": "One of the most omnipresent elements in the atmosphere is practically invisible and often ignored: spores. Plants of all varieties, fungal sentient life forms like mushroomfolk, and even animals emit these tiny pieces of life. You've always had an affinity for the natural world, and your innate magic is carried within the power of these omnipresent spores.\n  Spore sorcerers are regularly found among the mushroomfolk and derro who grow large gardens of fungi deep beneath the surface of the world. Spore sorcerers can also be found in any area with an abundance of plant life, such as forests, swamps, and deep jungles.\n\n##### Nature Magic\nYour affinity with the natural world and the spores that exist between all plants and creatures allows you to learn spells from the druid class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the druid spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.\n  In addition, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can cast *speak with plants* without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spore Transmission\nAt 1st level, your spores allow you to communicate with creatures telepathically. You can use a bonus action to create a telepathic link with one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the link ends, you can telepathically speak to the target, and, if it understands at least one language, it can speak telepathically to you. The link lasts for 10 minutes or until you use another bonus action to break the link or to establish this link with a different creature.\n  If the target is unwilling, it can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the link on a success. If an unwilling target ends the link in this way, you can't establish a link with that target again for 24 hours.\n\n##### Metamagic Spore Transmission\nStarting at 6th level, the spores connecting you and the target of your Spore Transmission enhance your metamagic effects on the linked target. You gain the following benefits when using the indicated Metamagic options:\n\n***Careful Spell.*** If the spell allows a target to take only half damage on a successful saving throw, the linked target instead takes no damage.\n\n***Distant Spell.*** When you use this Metamagic option to increase the range of a touch spell, the spell's range is 60 feet when cast on the linked target.\n\n***Extended Spell.*** If cast on the linked target, the spell's duration is tripled rather than doubled, to a maximum of 36 hours.\n\n***Hungry Spell.*** If the linked target is reduced to 0 hit points with your hungry spell, you regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2).\n\n***Lingering Spell.*** If the linked target failed its saving throw against your lingering spell, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid the additional damage at the start of your next turn.\n\n***Shared Hunger Spell.*** If you use this Metamagic option on the linked target, you and the target regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) if the target hits with its weapon attack.\n\n***Twinned Spell.*** By spending 1 additional sorcery point, you can affect the linked target in addition to the two original targets.\n\n##### Spore's Protection\nStarting at 14th level, when an attacker you can see targets you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to call forth spores to cloud its senses. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, you gain 10 temporary hit points as the spores bind the wound for a short time. The temporary hit points last for 1 minute.\n\n##### Spore Form\nAt 18th level, you gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. In addition, as an action, you can radiate spores in a 20-foot radius around you for 1 minute. Each friendly creature that starts its turn in the area regains hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). Each hostile creature that starts its turn in the area takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). The target of your Spore Transmission regains (if it is friendly) or takes (if it is hostile) double this amount. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Perhaps this attraction is due to a pact one of your ancestors made with an ancient eldritch horror. Perhaps it is an unfortunate twist of circumstance. Regardless, your physiology is in a constant state of transformation as a result of your condition. Some sorcerers who arise from magical wastelands embrace their body's modifications, others take to adventuring to find a cure for what they see as their affliction, while others still seek to make a mark on the world before oblivion claims them.\n\n##### Alien Alteration\nAt 1st level, the influence of raw magical energy in your bloodline remodeled your form. You choose one of the following features as the alteration from your ancestry.\n\n***Binary Mind.*** Your cranium is larger than most creatures of your type and houses your enlarged brain, which is partitioned in a manner that allows you to work on simultaneous tasks. You can use the Search action or make an Intelligence or Wisdom check as a bonus action on your turn.\n\n***Digitigrade Legs.*** Your legs are similar to the rear legs of a wolf or horse. Your movement speed increases by 10 feet, and you can stand up from prone by spending 5 feet of movement rather than half your speed.\n\n***Grasping Tentacle.*** You can use an action to transform one of your arms into a grotesque tentacle. The tentacle is a natural melee weapon with the reach property, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and the tentacle deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. At the start of your turn, if you are grappling a creature with the tentacle, you can deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage to it. You don't have fine motor control over your tentacle, and you can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of spells. You can revert your tentacle back into an arm as a bonus action.\n\n***Prehensile Tail.*** You have a prehensile tail, which allows you to take the Use an Object action as a bonus action on your turn. Your tail can't wield weapons or shields, but it is capable of some manual precision, allowing you to use your tail to hold material components or perform the somatic components of spells. In addition, you can interact with up to two objects for free during your movement and action, provided you use your tail to interact with one of the objects.\n\n##### Aberrant Physiology\nStarting at 1st level, when a creature scores a critical hit on you, you can use your reaction to shift the positions of your vital organs and turn the critical hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by critical hit are canceled.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Advanced Transformation\nAt 6th level, your increase in power also increases the concentration of raw magical energy in your blood, further altering your body. The alteration you chose from your Alien Alteration feature evolves as described below. Alternatively, you can choose a second option from the Alien Alteration feature instead of evolving the alteration you chose.\n\n***Caustic Tentacle (Grasping Tentacle).*** Your tentacle excretes acidic mucus. You can use a bonus action to suppress the mucus until the start of your next turn. While the tentacle excretes acidic mucus, it deals an extra 2d6 acid damage to any target it hits. A creature that is grappled by your tentacle at the start of your turn takes the extra acid damage when it takes the bludgeoning damage.\n\n***Cognitive Split (Binary Mind).*** Your cranium expands even further as your brain swells in size. When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use a bonus action to make one melee or ranged weapon attack against a target in range.\n\n***Fell Sprinter (Digitigrade Legs).*** Your legs elongate and your body sheds some of its weight to allow you to reach greater speeds. You can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of your turns. When you Dash, the extra movement you gain is double your speed instead of equal to your speed.\n\n***Third Arm (Prehensile Tail).*** Your tail extends to a length of 15 feet and the end splits into five fingerlike appendages. You can do anything with your tail you could do with a hand, such as wield a weapon. In addition, you can use your tail to drink a potion as a bonus action.\n\n##### Absorb Arcana\nStarting at 14th level, when you succeed on a saving throw against a spell that would deal damage to you, you can use your reaction and spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to reduce the damage to 0.\n\n##### Spontaneous Transformation\nAt 18th level, your body becomes more mutable. You can use a bonus action to gain a second option from the Alien Alteration feature and its evolved form from the Advanced Transformation feature for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

                    "desc": "Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance. \n \n##### Dragon Ancestor \n \nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. \n \n**Draconic Ancestry (table)** \n \n| Dragon | Damage Type | \n|--------|-------------| \n| Black  | Acid        | \n| Blue   | Lightning   | \n| Brass  | Fire        | \n| Bronze | Lightning   | \n| Copper | Acid        | \n| Gold   | Fire        | \n| Green  | Poison      | \n| Red    | Fire        | \n| Silver | Cold        | \n| White  | Cold        | \n \nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check. \n \n##### Draconic Resilience \n \nAs magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. \n \nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. \n \n##### Elemental Affinity \n \nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour. \n \n##### Dragon Wings \n \nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn. \n \nYou can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. \n \n##### Draconic Presence \n \nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.",

                    "desc": "The weave and flow of magic is mysterious and feared by many. Many study the nature of the arcane in hopes of learning to harness it, while sorcerers carry innate talent to sculpt and wield the errant strands of power that shape the world. Some sorcerers occasionally find their body itself becomes a conduit for such energies, their flesh collecting and storing remnants of their magic in the form of natural runes. These anomalies are known in erudite circles as runechildren. The talents of a runechild are rare indeed, and many are sought after for study by mages and scholars alike, driven by a prevalent belief that the secrets within their body can help understand many mysteries of the arcane. Others seek to enslave them, using their bodies as tortured spell batteries for their own diabolic pursuits. Their subjugation has driven the few that exist into hiding their essence \u2013 a task that is not easy, given the revealing nature of their gifts.\n\n##### Essence Runes\nAt 1st level, your body has begun to express your innate magical energies as natural runes that hide beneath your skin. You begin with 1 Essence Rune, and gain an addi- tional rune whenever you gain a level in this class. Runes can manifest anywhere on your body, though the first usually manifests on the forehead. They remain invisible when inert.\nAt the end of a turn where you spent any number of sorcery points for any of your class features, an equal number of essence runes glow with stored energy, becoming charged runes. If you expend a charged rune to use one of your Runechild features, it returns to being an inert essence rune.\nAs a bonus action, you may spend any number of sorcery points to convert an equal number of essence runes into charged runes. If you have no sorcery points and no charged runes, you can convert a single essence rune into a charged rune as an action\nIf you have 5 or more charged runes, you emit bright light in a 5 foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Any charged runes revert to inert essence runes after you complete a long rest.\n\n##### Glyphs of Aegis\nBeginning at 1st level, you can release the stored arcane power within your runes to absorb or deflect threatening attacks against you. Whenever you take damage from an attack, hazard, or spell, you can use a reaction to expend any number of charged runes, rolling 1d6 per charged rune. You subtract the total rolled from the damage inflicted by the attack, hazard, or spell.\nAt 6th level, you can use an action to expend a charged rune, temporarily transferring a Glyph of Aegis to a creature you touch. A creature can only hold a single glyph, and it lasts for 1 hour, or until the creature is damaged by an attack, hazard, or spell. The next time that creature takes damage from any of those sources, roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the damage roll. The glyph is then lost.\n\n##### Sigilic Augmentation\nUpon reaching 6th level, you can channel your runes to temporarily bolster your physical capabilities. You can expend a charged rune as a bonus action to enhance either your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, granting you advantage on ability checks with the chosen ability score until the start of your next turn. You can choose to main- tain this benefit additional rounds by expending a charged rune at the start of each of your following turns.\n\n##### Manifest Inscriptions\nAt 6th level, you can reveal hidden glyphs and enchantments that surround you. As an action, you can expend a charged rune to cause any hidden magical marks, runes, wards, or glyphs within 15 feet of you to reveal themselves with a glow for 1 round. This glow is considered dim light for a 5 foot radius around the mark or glyph.\n\n##### Runic Torrent\nUpon reaching 14th level, you can channel your stored runic energy to instill your spells with overwhelming arcane power, bypassing even the staunchest defenses. Whenever you cast a spell, you can expend a number of charged runes equal to the spell\u2019s level to allow it to ignore any resistance or immunity to the spell\u2019s damage type the targets may have.\n\n##### Arcane Exemplar Form\nBeginning at 18th level, you can use a bonus action and expend 6 or more charged runes to temporarily become a being of pure magical energy. This new form lasts for 3 rounds plus 1 round for each charged rune expended over 6. While you are in your exemplar form, you gain the following benefits: \n* You have a flying speed of 40 feet. \n* Your spell save DC is increased by 2. \n* You have resistance to damage from spells. \n* When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to the spell\u2019s level. When your Arcane Exemplar form ends, you can\u2019t move or take actions until after your next turn, as your body recovers from the transformation. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.",

            "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nAn event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell *burning hands* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *burning hands* using either slot. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. \n \n### Sorcerous Origin \n \nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level. \n \n### Font of Magic \n \nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. \n \n#### Sorcery Points \n \nYou have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Flexible Casting \n \nYou can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. \n \n**_Creating Spell Slots._** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. \n \nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest. \n \n**Creating Spell Slots (table)** \n \n| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost | \n|------------------|--------------------| \n| 1st              | 2                  | \n| 2nd              | 3                  | \n| 3rd              | 5                  | \n| 4th              | 6                  | \n| 5th              | 7                  | \n \n**_Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points._** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level. \n \n### Metamagic \n \nAt 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level. \n \nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. \n \n#### Careful Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell. \n \n#### Distant Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell. \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet. \n \n#### Empowered Spell \n \nWhen you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls. \n \nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. \n \n#### Extended Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. \n \n#### Heightened Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell. \n \n#### Quickened Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. \n \n#### Subtle Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. \n \n#### Twinned Spell \n \nWhen you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). \n \nTo be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, *magic missile* and *scorching ray* aren't eligible, but *ray of frost* and *chromatic orb* are. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Sorcerous Restoration \n \nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest. \n \n### Sorcerous Origins \n \nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.",

                    "desc": "You have made a pact with one or more ancient dragons or a dragon god. You wield a measure of their control over the elements and have insight into their deep mysteries. As your power and connection to your patron or patrons grows, you take on more draconic features, even sprouting scales and wings.\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nThe Great Dragons allows you to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n**Ancient Dragons Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                             | \n|---------------|------------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *inflict wounds*, *magic missile*   | \n| 2nd           | *heat metal*, *scorching ray*       | \n| 3rd           | *dispel magic*, *lightning bolt*    | \n| 4th           | *greater invisibility*, *ice storm* | \n| 5th           | *cloudkill*, *flame strike*         |\n\n##### Dragon Tongue\nStarting at 1st level, you can speak, read, and write Draconic.\n\n##### Wyrmling Blessing\nAlso starting at 1st level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons bestows a blessing upon you. When you finish a long rest, you choose which blessing to accept. You can have only one blessing at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Aquatic Affinity.*** You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater. In addition, you can communicate with beasts that can breathe water as if you had cast the *speak with animals* spell.\n\n***Draconic Hunger.*** When you are below half your hit point maximum and you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. This feature can restore you to no more than half of your hit point maximum.\n\n***Draconic Sight.*** You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, this blessing increases its range by 30 feet. In addition, you can use an action to create an invisible sensor within 30 feet of you in a location you can see or in an obvious location within range, such as behind a door or around a corner, for 1 minute. The sensor is an extension of your own senses, allowing you to see and hear through it as if you were in its place, but you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses while using this sensor. As a bonus action, you can move the sensor anywhere within 30 feet of you. The sensor can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, and if it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can use an action to end the sensor early.\n  A creature that can see the sensor, such as a creature benefiting from *see invisibility* or truesight, sees a luminous, intangible dragon's eye about the size of your fist.\n\n***Elemental Versatility.*** Choose one of the following when you accept this blessing: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You can't change the type until you finish a long rest and choose this blessing again. When you deal damage with a spell, you can choose for the spell's damage to be of the chosen type instead of its normal damage type.\n\n##### Draconic Mien\nAt 6th level, you begin to take on draconic aspects. When you finish a long rest, choose one of the following types of damage: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You have resistance to the chosen damage type. This resistance lasts until you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, as an action, you can harness a portion of your patrons' mighty presence, causing a spectral version of your dragon patron's visage to appear over your head. Choose up to three creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed or frightened (your choice) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a short or a long rest.\n\n##### Ascended Blessing\nAt 10th level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons grows stronger, granting you more powerful blessings. When you finish a long rest, you choose which ascended blessing to accept. While you have an ascended blessing, you receive the benefits of its associated wyrmling blessing in addition to any new features of the ascended blessing. You can have only one blessing active at a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Aquatic Command.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Aquatic Affinity wyrmling blessing. You can cast the *control water* and *dominate beast* spells without expending spell slots. When you cast the *dominate beast* spell, you can target only beasts that can breathe water. You can cast each spell once in this way and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.\n\n***Crystallized Hunger.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Hunger wyrmling blessing. When you kill a creature, you can crystallize a portion of its essence to create an essence gem. This gem functions as an *ioun stone of protection*, but it works only for you and has no value. As a bonus action, you can destroy the gem to regain one expended spell slot. You can have only one essence gem at a time. If you create a new essence gem while you already have an essence gem, the previous gem crumbles to dust and is destroyed. Once you create an essence gem, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Draconic Senses.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Draconic Sight wyrmling blessing. You have blindsight out to a range of 15 feet, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.\n\n***Elemental Expertise.*** While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of the Elemental Versatility wyrmling blessing. When you cast a spell that deals damage of the chosen type, including a spell you changed using Elemental Versatility, you add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of the spell. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to deal damage of the chosen type equal to your proficiency bonus to the attacker. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Draconic Manifestation\nAt 14th level, you can assume the form of a dragon. As an action, you can transform into a dragon with a challenge rating as high as your warlock level divided by 3, rounded down, for 1 minute. This transformation works like the *polymorph* spell, except you can take only the form of a dragon, and you don't need to maintain concentration to maintain the transformation. While you are in the form of a dragon, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. For the purpose of this feature, \u201cdragon\u201d refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles, drakes, and wyverns. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

                    "desc": "While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in the fey courts and the Upper Planes. These timeless entities are connected to every animal of the kind they represent, and their primary concerns are for the well-being of these animals and the natural world as a whole.\n  Your patron is one such animal lord. Animal lords are varied in their motivations and often come into conflict with each other. They each command legions of animal followers and gather information from all of them. Unlike many other patrons, animal lords often have close relationships with those they bind with pacts, some to control, others to guide and advise. You are your animal lord's hand in the affairs of humanoids, and your allies are as numerous as the spiders in the corner or the birds in the sky.\n  You choose a specific animal lord to be your patron using the Animal Lord table. Each type of animal in the world can potentially have an animal lord. If you want to follow a specific type of animal lord, work with your GM to determine the animal lord's affinity and beast type and where that animal lord fits in the world. For a deeper dive on specific animal lords and for their game statistics, see *Creature Codex* and *Tome of Beasts 2*. These books aren't required to choose an animal lord as your patron or to play this class option.\n\n**Animal Lords (table)**\n| Animal Lord        | Affinity | Beast Type              | \n|--------------------|----------|-------------------------| \n| Bat King           | Air      | Bats                    | \n| Brother Ox         | Earth    | Hooved mammals          | \n| Lord of Vultures   | Air      | Vultures, birds of prey | \n| Mouse King         | Earth    | Rodents                 | \n| Queen of Birds     | Air      | Birds                   | \n| Queen of Cats      | Earth    | Felines                 | \n| Queen of Serpents  | Earth    | Reptiles                | \n| Queen of Scorpions | Earth    | Arachnids               | \n| Toad King          | Water    | Amphibians              |\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nAnimal Lords let you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The Animal Lord Expanded Spells table shows the animal lord spells that are added to the warlock spell list for you, along with the spells associated with your patron's affinity: air, earth, or water.\n\n**Animal Lords Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level | Animal Lord Spells    | Air Spells       | Earth Spells         | Water Spells      | \n|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------| \n| 1st         | *Speak with Animals*  | *thunderwave*    | *longstrider*        | *fog cloud*       | \n| 2nd         | *mark prey*           | *gust of wind*   | *pass without trace* | *misty step*      | \n| 3rd         | *conjure animals*     | *fly*            | *phantom seed*       | *water breathing* | \n| 4th         | *polymorph*           | *storm of wings* | *sudden stampede*    | *control water*   | \n| 5th         | *commune with nature* | *insect plague*  | *hold monster*       | *cloudkill*       |\n\n##### Natural Blessing\nStarting at 1st level, you learn the *druidcraft* cantrip, and you gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill.\n\n##### Animalistic Insight\nAt 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to discern your foe's flaws to aid in its downfall. You can use an action to analyze one creature you can see within 30 feet of you and impart this information to your companions. You and a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency bonus each gain one of the following benefits (your choice). This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the analyzed creature dies. \n* You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against the analyzed creature. \n* You gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll when you hit the analyzed creature with an attack. \n* You have advantage on saving throws against the spells and effects of the analyzed creature. \n* When the analyzed creature attacks you, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 10th level in this class, each +1 bonus increases to +2.\n\n##### Patron Companion\nAt 6th level, your patron sends you a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. The companion acts as the animal lord's eyes and ears, allowing your patron to watch over you, and, at times, advise, warn, or otherwise communicate with you.\n  Choose a beast that relates to your patron (as shown in the Beast Type column in the Animal Lords table) that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. If you have the Pact of the Chain Pact Boon, this beast becomes your familiar.\n  Your patron companion is friendly to you and your companions, and you can speak with it as if you shared a language. It obeys your commands and, in combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. Your patron companion can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use a bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n  If your companion dies, your patron sends a new one to you after 24 hours. If your patron companions die too often, your patron might be reluctant to send a new one or might reprimand you in other ways.\n\n##### Primal Mastery\nAt 10th level, you can use your bond to your patron to tap into the innate connection between all animals. At the end of each short or long rest, choose one of the following benefits. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. \n* **Cat Eyes.** You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet. \n* **Chameleonic.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. \n* **Fangs.** You grow fangs. The fangs are a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your fangs, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and your fangs deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. \n* **Hold Breath.** You can hold your breath for 10 minutes. \n* **Keen Senses.** You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. \n* **Leap.** Your jump distance is doubled. \n* **Spry.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. \n* **Swift.** Your speed increases by 10 feet. \n* **Thick Hide.** You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class. \n* **Webbed Limbs.** You have a swimming speed of 20 feet.\n\n##### Call the Legions\nAt 14th level, you can summon a horde of beasts to come to your aid. As an action, you call upon your animal lord, and several beasts of your patron's type appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 60 feet of you. This works like a 7th-level *conjure* animals spell, except you don't need to maintain concentration. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

                    "desc": "The Hunter in Darkness is an entity that sees all creatures as prey and enjoys instilling fear in its prey. It prefers intelligent prey over mere beasts, as their fear tastes so much sweeter. Hunters who display impressive prowess for hunting pique its interest. The Hunter in Darkness often bestows its power on such individuals to spread fear further than the Hunter can by itself.\n  Though your patron isn't mindless, it cares only for the thrill of the hunt and the spreading of fear. It cares not what you do with the power it grants you beyond that. Your connection with the Hunter can sometimes cause changes in your worldview. You might view every creature you meet as either predator or prey, or you might face problems with a \u201ckill or be killed\u201d attitude.\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nThe Hunter in Darkness lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n**Hunters in Darkness Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                             | \n|---------------|------------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *bloodhound*, *hunter's endurance* | \n| 2nd           | *instant snare*, *mark prey*       | \n| 3rd           | *clairvoyance*, *nondetection*     | \n| 4th           | *harry*, *heart-seeking arrow*     | \n| 5th           | *killing fields*, *legend lore*    |\n\n##### Savage Hunter\nStarting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hp, its nearest ally within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.\n\n##### The Hunter in Darkness and Your Pact Boons\nWhen you select your pact boon at 3rd level, it is altered by your patron in the following ways.\n\n***Pact of the Chain.*** Your familiar is a hunting hound made of shadow, and it uses the statistics of a wolf.\n\n***Pact of the Blade.*** Your pact weapon can be a longbow or shortbow in addition to a melee weapon. You must provide arrows for the weapon.\n\n***Pact of the Tome.*** Your tome contains descriptions of tracks made by a multitude of creatures. If you consult your tome for 1 minute while inspecting tracks, you can identify the type of creature that left the tracks (such as a winter wolf), though not the creature's name or specific appearance (such as Frosttooth, the one-eyed leader of a notorious pack of winter wolves that terrorizes the area).\n\n##### Step Into Shadow\nBeginning at 6th level, you can disappear into darkness and reappear next to an enemy. As a bonus action while in dim light or darkness, you can disappear in a puff of inky smoke and reappear in an unoccupied space that is also in dim light or darkness within 5 feet of a creature within 30 feet of you. If that creature is frightened and you attack it, you have advantage on the attack roll. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Strike from the Dark\nBeginning at 10th level, your patron's constant hunger for fear inures you to it. You are immune to being frightened. In addition, when you are in dim light or darkness and you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.\n\n##### Avatar of Death\nStarting at 14th level, if you reduce a target to 0 hp with a weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to force each ally of the target within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. If a creature is immune to being frightened, it is instead stunned until the end of its next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

                    "desc": "You have made a pact with the ancient intelligence of a primeval forest. Before the rise of human civilization, before the time of the elves, before even the dragons, there were the forests. Empires rise and fall around them, but the forests remain as a testament to nature's endurance.\n\nHowever, times are changing, and the unchecked growth of civilization threatens the green. The intelligences that imbue the antediluvian forests seek emissaries in the world that can act beyond their boughs, and one has heard your call for power. You are a guardian of the Old Wood, a questing branch issuing from a vast, slumbering intelligence sent to act on its behalf, perhaps even to excise these lesser beings from its borders.\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nYour connection to the forest allows you to choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n**Old Wood Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                                      | \n|---------------|---------------------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *animal friendship*, *faerie fire*          | \n| 2nd           | *animal messenger*, *spike growth*          | \n| 3rd           | *conjure animals*, *protection from energy* | \n| 4th           | *conjure woodland beings*, *giant insect*   | \n| 5th           | *greater restoration*, *tree stride*        |\n\n##### Sap Magic\nAt 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to absorb magic from nearby spellcasting. When a creature casts a spell of a level you can cast or lower within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to synthesize the magic. The spell resolves as normal, but you have a 25% chance of regaining hit points equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).\n\n##### Forest's Defender\nAt 1st level, your patron gifts you with the skills necessary to defend it. You gain proficiency with shields, and you learn the *shillelagh* cantrip. *Shillelagh* counts as a warlock cantrip for you, but it doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.\n\n##### The Old Wood and Your Pact Boons\nWhen you select your pact boon at 3rd level, it is altered by your patron in the following ways:\n\n***Pact of the Chain.*** When you conjure your familiar or change its form, you can choose the form of an awakened shrub or child of the briar (see *Tome of Beasts*) in addition to the usual familiar choices.\n\n***Pact of the Blade.*** The blade of the Old Wood is a weapon made of wood and thorns and grows out of your palm. When you cast *shillelagh*, your Pact Blade is affected by the spell, regardless of the form your Pact Blade takes.\n\n***Pact of the Tome.*** The Old Wood grows a tome for you. The tome's cover is hardened bark from the forest's native trees, and its pages are leaves whose color changes with the seasons. If you want to add a new spell to your book, you must first plant it in the ground. After 1 hour, the book emerges from the soil with the new spell inscribed on its leaves. If your tome is lost or destroyed, you must return to your patron forest for it to grow you a new one.\n\n##### Predatory Grace\nStarting at 6th level, you are able to cast *pass without trace* without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. In addition, difficult terrain caused by roots, underbrush, and other natural forest terrain costs you no extra movement. You can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\n\n##### Nature's Endurance\nAt 10th level, your patron has suffused your body with a portion of its ability to withstand harmful magic. You gain resistance to damage from spells of a level you can cast or lower.\n\n##### Avatar of the Wood\nStarting at 14th level, you can channel the power of the forest to physically transform, taking on many of its aspects. Your legs, arms, and torso elongate, your body becomes covered in thick, dark bark, and branches sprout from your head as your hair recedes. You can transform as a bonus action and the transformation lasts 1 minute. While transformed, you gain the following benefits: \n* Your Armor Class is 16 plus your Dexterity modifier. \n* You gain tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet, and your attacks can reach 5 feet further. \n* Your hands become branch-like claws, and you can use the Attack action to attack with the claws. You are proficient with the claws, and the claws count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. You add your Charisma modifier to your attack and damage rolls with the claws. The damage is slashing and the damage die is a d6. If you have the Pact of the Blade feature, your claw attack benefits from your invocations as if it was a pact weapon. \n* Your Sap Magic feature changes to Arcasynthesis: When a spell of 5th level or lower is cast within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to synthesize the magic. The spell resolves as normal, but you have a 50 percent chance of regaining 1d10 hp per level of the spell cast.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

                    "desc": "Some who search for power settle on lesser gods or demon lords, others delve into deeper mysteries until they touch elder entities. These great entities build worlds, crafting mountains and species as if sculpting clay, or annihilate them utterly. Embodying creation, destruction, and the land itself, your patron is an ancient power beyond mortal understanding.\n  Primordials stand in opposition to the Great Old Ones, the other side of the scale that maintains the balance of reality. Your primordial patron speaks to you in the language of omens, dreams, or intuition, and may call upon you to defend the natural world, to root out the forces of the Void, or even to manipulate seemingly random people or locations for reasons known only to their unfathomable purpose. While you can't grasp the full measure of your patron's designs, as long as your bond is strong, there is nothing that can stand in your way.\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nThe Primordial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\n\n**Primordial Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                           | \n|---------------|----------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *command*, *healing word*        | \n| 2nd           | *lesser restoration*, *mud*      | \n| 3rd           | *power word fling*, *revivify*   | \n| 4th           | *power word rend*, *stone shape* | \n| 5th           | *conjure elemental*, *creation*  |\n\n##### Convulsion of the Worldbuilder\nAt 1st level, you can use an action to call upon the bond between your primordial patron and the world it created to ripple shockwaves through the ground. Choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you, then choose if the ripples happen in a 30-foot cone, a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, or a 20-foot-radius burst. The ripples originate from or are centered on the point you chose, depending on the form the ripples take. Each creature in the cone, line, or burst must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. If the ground in the area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: at 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\n\n##### Redirection\nAt 6th level, you learn to channel the reality-bending powers of your patron to avoid attacks. When a creature you can see attacks only you, you can use your reaction to redirect the attack to a target of your choice within range of the attacker's weapon or spell. If no other target is within range, you can't redirect the attack.\n  If the attack is from a spell of 4th level or higher, you must succeed on an ability check using your spellcasting ability to redirect it. The DC equals 12 + the spell's level.\n  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Adaptive Shroud\nAt 10th level, your bond with your patron protects you by adapting itself when you are injured. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. If you expend a spell slot as part of this reaction, the resistance lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Crushing Regard of the Primordial One\nAt 14th level, you learn to direct the weight of your patron's infinite gaze onto the unworthy. You can use an action to cause of the following effects. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n***One Creature.*** One creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d10 force damage and is paralyzed for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a paralyzed target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the condition ends on the target.\n\n***Multiple Creatures.*** Each creature in a 20-footradius sphere centered on a point you can see within 100 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.",

                    "desc": "Your patron is probability itself, the personified wellspring of chance as embodied by chosen deities, entities, and eldritch beings across the planes. By binding yourself to the Wyrdweaver, you live by the roll of the dice and the flip of the coin, delighting in the randomness of life and the thrill of new experiences. You might find yourself driven to invade a lich's keep to ask it about its favorite song, or you might leap onto a dragon's back to have the right to call yourself a dragonrider. Life with a pact-bond to your patron might not be long, but it will be exciting.\n\n##### Expanded Spell List\nThe Wyrdweaver lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock list for you.\n\n**Wyrdweaver Expanded Spells (table)**\n| Spell Level   | Spells                             | \n|---------------|------------------------------------| \n| 1st           | *bane*, *faerie fire*              | \n| 2nd           | *blur*, *frenzied bolt*            | \n| 3rd           | *bestow curse*, *hypnotic pattern* | \n| 4th           | *compulsion*, *reset*              | \n| 5th           | *battle mind*, *mislead*           |\n\n##### Probability Wellspring\nStarting at 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate probability. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel your patron abilities. The number of probability dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.\n  You can use these dice to turn the odds in your or your ally's favor. When you or a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend probability dice from the pool, rolling the dice and adding the total result to that roll. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.\n  When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your probability dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).\n\n##### Appropriate Advantage\nAt 1st level, you learn to shift the weaves of fate to aid allies and hinder foes. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to expend one probability die and force that creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, adding the probability die to the DC. On a failed save, the creature loses advantage on that roll, and one friendly creature you can see within 60 feet has advantage on its next d20 roll of the same type the creature used (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw).\n\n##### Improbable Duplicate\nAt 6th level, you can channel dark power from your patron to empower your attacks and spells. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend one or more probability dice, up to half your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), and add the probability dice to the attack's damage roll.\n\n##### Inconceivable Channeling\nAt 10th level, you learn to redirect magical energy, converting the power to restore your pool of probability dice. When a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to take the damage instead. You halve the damage you take as your probability wellspring absorbs some of the magical energy. For every 10 damage prevented in this way, you regain one expended probability die. You can't regain more than half your maximum probability dice from this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Favored Soul\nStarting at 14th level, your very presence spins probability. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature loses advantage on the roll and has disadvantage on it, and you have advantage on one d20 roll of your choice within the next minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. \n \n##### Fiendish Resilience \n \nStarting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance. \n \n##### Hurl Through Hell \n \nStarting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. \n \nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. \n \nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Pact Magic \n \nYour arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table. \n \n#### Spell Slots \n \nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. \n \nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *thunderwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell. \n \n#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher \n \nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. \n \nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. \n \n### Eldritch Invocations \n \nIn your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. \n \nAt 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. \n \nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. \n \n### Pact Boon \n \nAt 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. \n \n#### Pact of the Chain \n \nYou learn the *find familiar* spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. \n \nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. \n \nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction. \n \n#### Pact of the Blade \n \nYou can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. \n \nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. \n \nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. \n \n#### Pact of the Tome \n \nYour patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. \n \nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\n\n\n \n> ### Your Pact Boon \n> \n> Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature. \n> \n> **_Pact of the Chain._** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it. \n> \n> **_Pact of the Blade._** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye. \n> \n> **_Pact of the Tome._** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Mystic Arcanum \n \nAt 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. \n \nYou can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. \n \nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest. \n \n### Eldritch Master \n \nAt 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. \n \n### Eldritch Invocations \n \nIf an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. \n \n#### Agonizing Blast \n \n*Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip* \n \nWhen you cast *eldritch blast*, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit. \n \n#### Armor of Shadows \n \nYou can cast *mage armor* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Ascendant Step \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *levitate* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Beast Speech \n \nYou can cast *speak with animals* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Beguiling Influence \n \nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. \n \n#### Bewitching Whispers \n \n*Prerequisite: 7th level* \n \nYou can cast *compulsion* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Book of Ancient Secrets \n \n*Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature* \n \nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag. \n \nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. \n \n#### Chains of Carceri \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature* \n \nYou can cast *hold monster* at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again. \n \n#### Devil's Sight \n \nYou can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet. \n \n#### Dreadful Word \n \n*Prerequisite: 7th level* \n \nYou can cast *confusion* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Eldritch Sight \n \nYou can cast *detect magic* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Eldritch Spear \n \n*Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip* \n \nWhen you cast *eldritch blast*, its range is 300 feet. \n \n#### Eyes of the Rune Keeper \n \nYou can read all writing. \n \n#### Fiendish Vigor \n \nYou can cast *false life* on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Gaze of Two Minds \n \nYou can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings. \n \n#### Lifedrinker \n \n*Prerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature* \n \nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). \n \n#### Mask of Many Faces \n \nYou can cast *disguise self* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Master of Myriad Forms \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level* \n \nYou can cast *alter self* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Minions of Chaos \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *conjure elemental* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Mire the Mind \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level* \n \nYou can cast *slow* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Misty Visions \n \nYou can cast *silent image* at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### One with Shadows \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level* \n \nWhen you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction. \n \n#### Otherworldly Leap \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *jump* on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. \n \n#### Repelling Blast \n \n*Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip* \n \nWhen you hit a creature with *eldritch blast*, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line. \n \n#### Sculptor of Flesh \n \n*Prerequisite: 7th level* \n \nYou can cast *polymorph* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Sign of Ill Omen \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level* \n \nYou can cast *bestow curse* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Thief of Five Fates \n \nYou can cast *bane* once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest. \n \n#### Thirsting Blade \n \n*Prerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature* \n \nYou can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. \n \n#### Visions of Distant Realms \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level* \n \nYou can cast *arcane eye* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Voice of the Chain Master \n \n*Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature* \n \nYou can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar's senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar's senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech. \n \n#### Whispers of the Grave \n \n*Prerequisite: 9th level* \n \nYou can cast *speak with dead* at will, without expending a spell slot. \n \n#### Witch Sight \n \n*Prerequisite: 15th level* \n \nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight. \n \n### Otherworldly Patrons \n \nThe beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return. \n \nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.",

For you, these cantrips count as wizard cantrips and don't count against the number of cantrips you know. In addition, any cantrip you learn or can cast from any other source, such as from a racial trait or feat, counts as a wizard cantrip for you.\n\n##### Arcane Alacrity\nAlso at 2nd level, whenever you cast a wizard cantrip that has a casting time of an action, you can change the casting time to a bonus action for that casting. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.\n  When you reach 10th level in this class, you regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n##### Potent Spellcasting\nStarting at 6th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard cantrip you can cast.\n\n##### Adroit Caster\nStarting at 10th level, if you cast a cantrip that doesn't deal damage or a cantrip that has an effect in addition to damage, such as the speed reduction of the *ray of frost* spell, that cantrip or effect has twice the normal duration.\n\n##### Empowered Cantrips\nStarting at 14th level, once per turn, when you cast a wizard cantrip that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.",

In addition, you can still perform the somatic components of wizard spells even when you have a longbow or shortbow in one or both hands.\n\n##### Unseen Assailant\nStarting at 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can choose a target you can see within 60 feet of you and become invisible to that target until the start of your next turn. Once the effect ends, you can't use this feature on that target again until you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spell Arrow\nBeginning at 6th level, you can imbue an arrow you fire from a longbow or shortbow with magical energy. As a bonus action, you can expend a 1st-level spell slot to cause the next arrow you fire to magically deal an extra 2d4 force damage to the target on a hit. If you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.\n\n##### Pinpoint Weakness\nAt 10th level, when you hit a creature with an arrow imbued by your Spell Arrow feature, your next ranged weapon attack against that creature has advantage.\n\n##### Multitudinous Arrows\nStarting at 14th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action with a longbow or shortbow on your turn. If you use your Spell Arrow feature, you can imbue both arrows with arcane power by expending one spell slot. If you imbue two arrows with this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.",

                    "desc": "Each wizard has a strong connection with their familiar, but some mages eschew specializing in a school of magic in favor of forming a powerful bond with a familiar. This bond allows the two to work in tandem in ways that few arcane practitioners could even dream of. Those who encounter such a familiar never look at a rodent or bird the same way again.\n\n##### Familiar Savant\nBeginning when you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you learn the *find familiar* spell if you don't know it already. You innately know this spell and don't need to have it scribed in your spellbook or prepared in order to cast it. When you cast *find familiar*, the casting time is 1 action, and it requires no material components.\n  You can cast *find familiar* without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, when you cast the *find familiar* spell, you can choose for your familiar to take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1/4 or lower, such as a flying snake, giant moth (see *Creature Codex*), or giant armadillo (see *Tome of Beasts 2*). The familiar has the statistics of the chosen beast form, but it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.\n  When you reach 6th level in this class, your familiar can take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1 or lower. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, your familiar can be any Tiny celestial, dragon, fey, or fiend that is CR 1 or lower.\n\n##### Greater Familiar\nAlso at 2nd level, when you cast *find familiar*, your familiar gains the following additional benefits: \n* Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, and it uses your proficiency bonus in place of its own when making ability checks and saving throws. It is proficient in any saving throw in which you are proficient. \n* Your familiar's hit points equal its normal hit point maximum or 1 + your Intelligence modifier + three times your wizard level, whichever is higher. It has a number of Hit Dice (d4s) equal to your wizard level. \n* In combat, your familiar shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take any action in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the familiar can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. \n* Your familiar's attacks are enhanced by the magic bond you share with it. When making attack rolls, your familiar uses your spell attack bonus or its normal attack bonus, whichever is higher. In addition, when your familiar hits with an attack, the attack deals force damage equal to 1d4 + its Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus instead of its normal damage. If the familiar's attack normally deals additional damage, such as a flying snake's poison, or has an additional effect, such as an octopus's grapple, the familiar's attack still has that additional damage or effect. \n* Your familiar's Intelligence increases to 8 unless it is already higher. It can understand and speak Common and either Celestial (if celestial), Sylvan (if fey), or Abyssal or Infernal (if fiend).\n\n##### Strengthened Bond\nStarting at 6th level, your magical bond with your familiar grows stronger. If your familiar has a trait or action that forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. In addition, you can access your familiar's senses by using either an action or a bonus action, and whenever your familiar is within 100 feet of you, it can expend its reaction to deliver any wizard spell you cast. If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more, you must be sharing your familiar's senses before casting the spell. If the spell requires an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you use your own statistics to adjudicate the result.\n\n##### Arcane Amplification\nStarting at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard spell you cast through your familiar. In addition, your familiar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n\n##### Companion Concentration\nStarting at 14th level, when you are concentrating on a spell of 3rd level or lower, you can use an action to draw on your connection with your familiar to pass the burden of concentration onto it, freeing you up to concentrate on a different spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",

Gravebinders focus their efforts on safeguarding tombs and graveyards to ensure the dead remain at rest and the living remain safe from the dead. When undead rise to prey upon the living, a gravebinder hunts downs the abominations and returns them to their eternal slumber.\n\n##### Restriction: The Dead Must Rest\nWhen you choose this wizard arcane tradition, you can no longer cast spells that animate, conjure, or create undead, and, if any such spells are copied in your spellbook, they fade from the book within 24 hours, leaving blank pages where the spells were.\n\n##### Gravebinder Lore\nAt 2nd level, you can use an action to inscribe a small rune on a corpse. While this rune remains, the corpse can't become undead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  In addition, you have proficiency in the Religion skill if you don't already have it, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks made to recall lore about deities of death, burial practices, and the afterlife.\n\n##### Hunter of the Dead\nStarting at 2nd level, you gain access to spells passed down by generations of gravebinders. The *heart to heart* (2nd), *dead walking* (3rd), *gird the spirit* (3rd), *life from death* (5th), and *lay to rest* (9th) spells are wizard spells for you, and you add them to your spellbook at the indicated wizard levels (see the Magic and Spells chapter for details on these spells). Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\n  Also at 2nd level, you can use your action and expend one wizard spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether undead are present within 1 mile of you. You know the general direction of the undead creatures, though not their exact locations or numbers, and you know the direction of the most powerful undead within range.\n\n##### Ward Against the Risen\nStarting at 6th level, when an undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you targets an ally with an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to hamper the attack or spell. The undead has disadvantage on its attack roll or your ally has advantage on its saving throw against the undead's spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Disruptive Touch\nBeginning at 10th level, when an undead creature takes damage from a 1st-level or higher spell you cast, it takes an extra 4d6 radiant damage. Undead creatures you kill using this feature are destroyed in a puff of golden motes.\n\n##### Radiant Nimbus\nAt 14th level, you can use your action to envelope yourself in a shroud of golden flames for 1 minute. While enveloped, you gain the following benefits: \n* When you summon the flames and as an action on each of your turns while the flames are active, you can frighten undead within 30 feet of you. Each undead creature in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the flames fade or until it takes damage. An undead creature with sunlight sensitivity (or hypersensitivity, in the case of vampires) also takes 4d6 radiant damage if it fails the saving throw. \n* You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight. \n* When an undead creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, it takes 2d10 radiant damage.\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.",

                    "desc": "Liminal spaces are spaces on the boundary, at the edge between what's real and what's unreal. A liminal space can be neither here nor there, and yet be both *here and there* at the same time. Stories of liminal spaces are common across cultures, though their true nature often isn't recognized by the uninitiated: the stranger who appears suddenly at a lonely crossroads, the troll that snatches at unwary travelers from a hiding spot beneath a bridge where no such hiding spot exists, the strangely familiar yet unsettlingly different scene that's sometimes glimpsed in a looking glass.\n  These are only the most obvious encounters with liminal spaces! Most liminalities are more easily overlooked, being as unconscious as the heartbeat between waking and sleeping, as fleeting as drawing in breath as an apprentice and exhaling it as a master, or as unassumingly familiar\u2014and as fraught with potential\u2014as a doorway that's crossed a hundred times without incident.\n  Those who specialize in liminal magic are known as liminists. They've learned to tap into the mysticism at the heart of spaces between spaces and to bend the possibilities inherent in transitional moments to their own ends. Like filaments of a dream, strands of liminality can be woven into forms new and wondrous\u2014or strange and terrifying.\n\n##### Liminal Savant\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a liminal spell (see the Magic and Spells chapter) into your spellbook is halved.\n\n##### Mulligan\nAt 2nd level, you can control the moment between an attempt at something and the result of that attempt to shift the flow of battle in your favor. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you misses with an attack, you can use your reaction to allow that creature to reroll the attack. Similarly, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits with an attack but hasn't yet rolled damage, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll the attack and use the lower result. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n  When you reach 10th level in this class, you can use this feature when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or saving throw.\n\n##### Otherworldly Sense\nAt 6th level, if you spend 1 minute meditating and expanding your senses outward, you can sense those not of this world\u2014those who slip through the cracks of the in-between to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting. For 10 minutes, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you: aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. As long as you maintain your concentration, you can use an action to change the type of creature you sense. You know the direction to each lone creature or group, but not the distance or the exact number in a group. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Liminal Adept\nAt 10th level, you add the *threshold slip* spell (see the Magic and Spells chapter) to your spellbook, if it isn't there already. You can cast *threshold slip* without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can bring up to two willing creatures of your size or smaller that you're touching with you. The target junction must have unoccupied spaces for all of you to enter when you reappear, or the spell fails.\n  You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature three times between rests.\n\n##### Forced Transition\nAt 14th level, your mastery over moments of change is unequivocal. You can use an action to touch a willing creature or make a melee spell attack against an unwilling creature, choosing one of the following effects. The effect lasts for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n***Rapid Advancement.*** The target's ability scores are each increased by 2. An ability score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\n***Regression.*** The target's ability scores are each reduced by 2. This effect can't reduce an ability score below 1.\n\n***True Self.*** The target can't change its shape through any means, including spells, such as *polymorph*, and traits, such as the werewolf 's Shapechanger trait. The target immediately reverts to its true form if it is currently in a different form. This option has no effect on illusion spells, such as *disguise self*, or a creature that appears changed from the effects of an illusion, such as a hag's Illusory Appearance.",

                    "desc": "Some wizards pride themselves on being spell artisans, carefully sculpting the magical energy of spells like smiths sculpt iron. Focusing on the artistry inherent in spellcasting, these wizards learn to tap the magical energy of spells and manipulate that energy to amplify or modify spells like no other arcane practitioners.\n\n##### Arcane Emendation\nBeginning when you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you can manipulate the magical energy in scrolls to change the spells written on them. While holding a scroll, you can spend 1 hour for each level of the spell focusing on the magic within the scroll to change the spell on the scroll to another spell. The new spell must be of the same school, must be on the wizard spell list, and must be of the same or lower level than the original spell. If the new spell has any material components with a cost, you must provide those when changing the scroll's original spell to the new spell, and the components are consumed as the new spell's magic overwrites the original spell on the scroll.\n\n##### Spell Transformation\nAt 2nd level, you learn to mold the latent magical energy of your spells to cast new spells. While concentrating on a wizard spell that you cast using a spell slot, you can use an action to end your concentration on that spell and use the energy to cast another wizard spell you have prepared without expending a spell slot. The new spell must be half the level (minimum of 1st) of the spell on which you were concentrating, and the new spell's casting time must be 1 action.\n  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spell Honing\nAt 6th level, you can hold onto the magic of lasting spells or siphon off some of their magic to amplify spells you cast. If your concentration is broken (willingly or unwillingly), the spell's magic lingers, causing the spell's effects to remain until the end of your next turn.\n  In addition, while concentrating on a spell with a duration of concentration up to 1 minute or concentration up to 10 minutes, you can amplify a wizard spell you cast of 1st level or higher. When you amplify a spell in this way, the duration of the spell on which you are concentrating is reduced by a number of rounds (if the duration is concentration up to 1 minute) or minutes (if the duration is concentration up to 10 minutes) equal to the amplified spell's level. You can choose only one of the following options when amplifying a spell: \n* Increase the saving throw DC by 2 \n* Increase the spell attack bonus by 2 \n* Add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of the spell\n  You can amplify a spell this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n##### Spell Reversion\nAt 10th level, you learn to manipulate the magical energy of spells cast against you. When you must make a saving throw to end an ongoing effect, such as the frightened condition of the fear spell or the slowing effect of a copper dragon's slowing breath, you have advantage on the saving throw.\n  In addition, when an ongoing condition you successfully end on yourself was from a spell cast by a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to force that creature to make the same saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature suffers the effect or condition you just ended on yourself until the end of its next turn. For example, if you succeed on the saving throw to end the paralyzed condition on yourself from the hold person spell cast by a spellcaster you can see, you can force that spellcaster to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, and that spellcaster becomes paralyzed until the end of its next turn on a failed save.\n\n##### Spell Duality\nAt 14th level, you become a master at manipulating and extending the magical energy of your longlasting spells. You can concentrate on two spells simultaneously. If you cast a third spell that requires concentration, you lose concentration on the oldest spell. When you take damage while concentrating on a spell and must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, you make one saving throw for each source of damage, as normal. You don't have to make one saving throw for each spell you are maintaining.\n  If you are concentrating on two spells and fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration because of taking damage, you lose concentration on the oldest spell. If you are concentrating on two spells and lose concentration on both spells in 1 round, you suffer one level of exhaustion.",

Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants. \n \n##### Evocation Savant \n \nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved. \n \n##### Sculpt Spells \n \nBeginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save. \n \n##### Potent Cantrip \n \nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. \n \n##### Empowered Evocation \n \nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast. \n \n##### Overchannel \n \nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell. \n \nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.",

            "desc": "### Spellcasting \n \nAs a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. \n \n#### Cantrips \n \nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. \n \n#### Spellbook \n \nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\n \n> ### Your Spellbook \n> \n> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. \n> \n> **_Copying a Spell into the Book._** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. \n> \n> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation. \n> \n> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells. \n> \n> **_Replacing the Book._** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. \n> \n> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. \n> \n> **_The Book's Appearance._** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\n \n#### Preparing and Casting Spells \n \nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. \n \nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. \n \nFor example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *magic missile,* you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. \n \nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. \n \n#### Spellcasting Ability \n \nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. \n \n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \n \n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier \n \n#### Ritual Casting \n \nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. \n \n#### Spellcasting Focus \n \nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. \n \n#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher \n \nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the \u201cYour Spellbook\u201d sidebar).\n \n### Arcane Recovery \n \nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. \n \nFor example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. \n \n### Arcane Tradition \n \nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description. \n \nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. \n \n### Ability Score Improvement \n \nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. \n \n### Spell Mastery \n \nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. \n \nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. \n \n### Signature Spells \n \nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. \n \nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. \n \n### Arcane Traditions \n \nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study. \n \nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.",
