You must use the new rolls.\r\n\r\nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.\r\n\r\n### Extended Spell\r\n\r\nWhen you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.\r\n\r\n### Heightened Spell\r\n\r\nWhen you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.\r\n\r\n### Quickened Spell\r\n\r\nWhen you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.\r\n\r\n### Subtle Spell\r\n\r\nWhen you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.\r\n\r\n### Twinned Spell\r\n\r\nWhen you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).\r\n\r\nTo be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.",

You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.\r\n\r\n### Spell Slots\r\n\r\nThe Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.\r\n\r\n### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\r\n\r\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.\r\n\r\nThe Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\r\n\r\n### Spellcasting Ability\r\n\r\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n**Spell save DC = 8** + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\r\n\r\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\r\nSpellcasting Focus\r\n\r\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.",

Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\r\n\r\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.\r\n\r\n### Chains of Carceri\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature\r\n\r\nYou can cast hold monster at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components.

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.\r\n\r\n### Lifedrinker\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature\r\n\r\nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\r\n\r\n### Mask of Many Faces\r\n\r\nYou can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.\r\n\r\n### Master of Myriad Forms\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: 15th level\r\n\r\nYou can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot.\r\n\r\n### Minions of Chaos\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: 9th level\r\n\r\nYou can cast conjure elemental once using a warlock spell slot.

You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Sign of Ill Omen\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: 5th level\r\n\r\nYou can cast bestow curse once using a warlock spell slot.

Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar's senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.\r\n\r\n### Whispers of the Grave\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: 9th level\r\n\r\nYou can cast speak with dead at will, without expending a spell slot.\r\n\r\n### Witch Sight\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: 15th level\r\n\r\nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight.",

The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.\r\n\r\nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.\r\n\r\n### Pact of the Blade\r\n\r\nYou can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\r\n\r\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\r\n\r\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.\r\n\r\n### Pact of the Tome\r\n\r\nYour patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\r\n\r\n### Spellbook\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\r\n\r\n### Preparing and Casting Spells\r\n\r\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\r\n\r\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\r\n\r\n### Spellcasting Ability\r\n\r\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n\r\n**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\r\n\r\n### Ritual Casting\r\n\r\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.\r\n\r\n### Spellcasting Focus\r\n\r\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\r\n\r\n### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\r\n\r\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the \u201cYour Spellbook\u201d sidebar).",
