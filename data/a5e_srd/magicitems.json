In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the portable hole cannot be restored to life by __revivify , raise dead_ , or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside a closed _portable hole_ can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to _suffocate_ .\n\nCreatures inside the hole while it’s open can exit the hole by simply climbing out. A creature still within the hole can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check to escape as it is being closed. On a success, the creature appears within 5 feet of the item or creature carrying it.\n\nPlacing a _portable hole_ inside another extradimensional storage device such as a _bag of holding_ or __handy haversack_  results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane.

The rune is destroyed as its magic is absorbed by the corpse, animating it as a _zombie_ . When placing the rune, you can feed it a portion of your life force by spending hit points. The zombie obeys your spoken commands and is friendly to you and your companions for 1 round per hit point you spent when placing the rune.

On a 1, the wand violently shakes and sparks with magic then disappears.\n\n__**Table: Wand of Wonder**__\n| **d100** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 01–05    | You cast _slow ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| 06–10    | You cast __faerie fire ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 11–15    | You are awestruck and become _stunned_  until the start of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 16–20    | You cast _gust of wind ._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 21–25    | You cast __detect thoughts_  on the target.

Success on a DC 28 Deception check convinces the eye that some horrifying and frightening threat is inevitably soon to befall it. Rather than accept its fate, the eye destroys itself and blinks out of existence.

When its creator was killed by an orcish warchief it became a weapon, and in her hands it grew to find a new purpose. It eventually convinced its bearer to sow what she reaped, and caused the very spirit and blood of those she had cut down to slaughter its orcish captors. _Harvest_ has come to believe that all people are inherently wicked and deserve death. It believes that real peace can only be achieved when the last mind capable of war and cruelty goes silent, leaving nothing but the plants and beasts. _Harvest_ tolerates people with a connection to nature but only if they are regularly giving it a chance to continue its “culling”. It whispers often of its great work, and begs you to enrich the earth’s soil with blood that it spills. If you go more than 3 days without using Harvest to slay a sentient creature, you’ll be in conflict with _Harvest_. When in conflict, any time you use the Sow the Reaped property the resulting blood clone ignores your verbal orders and attacks you to the best of its ability. If you are killed by the blood clone in this way, your soul is absorbed into _Harvest_. \n\n_**Destroying Harvest.**_ _Harvest_ is unbreakable but a person that has mastered nature can unmake it. With 24 hours worth of ritual work, any 20th level druid can deconstruct the weapon and return its tortured mind to the earth it was formed from, rendering _Harvest_ an inert mundane sickle made with a moonstone blade.",

Without this illusion, a twisted demonic form is revealed: the blade is composed of a single sharpened tooth, what appears to be the hilt is instead a grotesque sucker-like mouth, and the ruby pommel is a figment covering a single great crimson eye that stares with fiendish intelligence.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic longsword. An intense burning heat radiates from the blade and it deals an extra 3d6 fire damage on a successful hit. \n\n_**Attached Properties.**_ While attached to _Skrivena Moc,_ you gain resistance to fire, proficiency with longswords, and after taking the Attack action on your turn you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using it.

The longsword communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Abyssal, Common, and up to 3 other languages of the Narrator’s choice.\n\n_**Personality.**_ _Skrivena Moc_ needs a wielder to accomplish much of anything and it is a peerless manipulator. Wrathful and vindictive, the fiend blade sees those who carry it as insignificant and a means to an end. However it has been stuck in this form for centuries and has learned to maintain a helpful and subservient façade to better facilitate the careful orchestration of events whenever possible, only revealing its true intentions as a last resort. Once wielded, the fiend blade grabs hold and cannot be dropped. The demon makes hasty apologies for its “curse”, manipulating its wielder into serving its will—it acts as a powerful weapon but slowly drains away their vital essences until they die, all the while using them to track down potential cures for its transformation.\n\n**Forgotten Fiend**\n\nLong ago Skrivena Moc was defeated by the great elven wizard Stariji. Rather than banish the demon and allow it to reform in the Abyss, the mage transformed the evil monster into something more useful: a sword to bestow upon her champions. It suffered for centuries as a tool of justice, made to forcefully cut down hundreds of fiends in the name of its most hated enemy. After nearly a millennium of belligerent service however, Stariji finally succumbed to her age and died peacefully in her bed. With the elven wizard and all her champions gone Skrivena Moc was left to molder deep within its cursed enemy’s home amongst other treasures—but as centuries passed it eventually was discovered and has escaped to wreak havoc on the world once more.\n\nSkrivena Moc constructs a web of lies, propping itself up as Stariji’s most trusted warrior who chose to serve the elven mage against evil even after death. It promises everything an adventurer could want and more if only they’ll wield it—and the demon keeps its promises, in a way. The fiend blade is powerful even in untrained hands, though it is also full of deception. Whatever lies and half-truths the sword produces, it has only one goal in mind: Skrivena Moc wishes to return to its true demonic form. Stariji’s old enchantment has weakened over the centuries and allowed for some of its fiendish essence to leach out, but it still cannot escape the mage’s trap. As it seems the old wizard never shared her techniques, Skrivena Moc must find her spellbook, the only known source that contains the techniques to restore its form. Even death cannot save it, as the mage ensured that it cannot be destroyed only to reform in the Abyss while in this cursed shape.\n\n**Skrivena Moc, Whispering Blade Challenge 4+**\n\n_Small fiend_ 1,100 XP+\n\n**Armor Class** 19 (natural armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 180 (19d6+114)\n\n**Speed** 0 ft.\n\n**STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA**\n\n26 (+8)15 (+2)22 (+6)20 (+5)16 (+3)22 (+6)\n\n**Proficiency** +3; **Maneuver DC** 19\n\n**Saving Throws** Con +8, Wis +5, Cha +8\n\n**Skills** Arcana +9, Deception +10, History +9, Insight +7, Intimidation +10, Investigation +9, Perception +7, Persuasion +10\n\n**Damage Resistances** cold, lightning; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons\n\n**Damage Immunities** fire, poison\n\n**Condition Immunities** _poisoned_ \n\n**Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 17\n\n**Languages** Abyssal, Common, telepathy 120 ft.\n\n_**Death Throes.**_ When Skrivena Moc dies it explodes and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Skrivena Moc can use a bonus action to activate or dismiss this illusion.\n\n_**Variable Challenge Rating.**_ Skrivena Moc’s CR is equal to its wielder’s level or CR (minimum CR 4).\n\nACTIONS\n\n**_Corrupting Siphon (Recharge 5–6)_**.

Skrivena Moc uses its natural resistances to filter out its wielder’s ailments, ending either the _poisoned_  condition or one nonmagical _disease_  afflicting the attached creature.\n\n_**Grip of Control.**_ The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Wisdom _saving throw_  or temporarily loses control to the fiend blade until the end of Skrivena Moc’s next turn (as __dominate person_ ).\n\n_**Trusty Blade**_. The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Charisma _saving throw_  or it is _charmed_  for the next hour. If the attached creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. \n\nREACTIONS\n\n_**Fiendish Attachment.**_ When a creature grasps Skrivena Moc’s hilt, it can use reaction to attach to the creature. Once attached, the creature cannot let go and is forced to wield Skrivena Moc with whatever limb it used to grab the hilt. Skrivena Moc can use an action to detach from a creature and otherwise detaches when it dies, the attached limb is severed, or if it is dealt 35 or more radiant damage in a single round.\n\n_**Justified Paranoia**_. Whenever Skrivena Moc hears its name mentioned or is otherwise suspicious of a creature, it can use its reaction to telepathically delve into the creature’s mind (as _detect thoughts_ ; save DC 19).",

While mimicking a normal chest in this way it is indistinguishable from its mundane counterpart.\n\n_**Multiple Interiors.** The Traveling Chest_ has 1,000 different interior spaces, each 5 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet tall. You can verbally request any particular space (such as the last one, or the one with my laundry in it) and when opened the chest reveals that interior. Otherwise the chest opens to reveal a random interior space. While the chest is closed, all of its interior spaces are located within separate pocket dimensions. These pocket dimensions have no air, and any Supply stored within them instantly deteriorates and rots as if decades have passed as soon as the chest is closed. Only you can summon up the other interiors in this way, and any other creature that opens the chest only finds the “first interior”.\n\n_**Relentless.**_ Once you attune to _The Traveling Chest_, it relentlessly follows you until it sits no more than 15 feet away from you. The chest is magically aware of your location at all times, even if you are on a separate plane. If separated from you the chest travels towards you as fast as it can to the best of its ability and it attacks any creature that attempts to hinder its progress. If you are functionally unreachable, such as being on a different plane or across an ocean, the chest still progresses using even esoteric or hidden methods of reaching you such as magic portals or stowing away on ships headed in your direction.\n\n_**Imprinted.**_ _The Traveling Chest_ does not relinquish attunement once attuned, and you cannot voluntarily remove this attunement. If you attune to additional magic items beyond your limit, _The Traveling Chest_ always remains as one of your attuned items. \n\n_**Pack Lightly.** The Traveling Chest_ does not like being weighed down too much, and can carry a maximum of 10 bulky items. Any additional bulky items you attempt to store within it are spit out. \n\n_**Sentience.** The Traveling Chest_ is a sentient construct with Intelligence 3, Wisdom 14, and Charisma 12\\. It has blindsight to a range of 60 feet. _The Traveling Chest_ cannot speak or read, but it understands Common and Elvish. _The Traveling Ches_t lacks proper communication, but can animalistically communicate simple emotions (most often boredom or rage).\n\n_**Personality.**_ _The Traveling Chest_ has the intellect and temperament of a poorly trained dog. Loyalty has been branded magically into its psyche but its actual obedience is looser. The chest is playful and quick to anger, yet is utterly committed to following whomever is attuned to it. It also isn’t a fighter and ignores outright commands to attack, though it defends itself in combat when it is attacked. It likes to be used for its intended purpose, happiest when numerous items are stored within it and regularly retrieved. If left idle or unused for more than a day it will come into conflict. While in conflict the chest intentionally opens to the wrong interior spaces, or remains indignantly locked, and it generally acts snippy and uncooperative. An apology and DC 14 Animal Handling or Persuasion check calms the chest down and ends the conflict, or if it feels genuinely mistreated, it can be offered a full wardrobe’s worth of new clothing to store as a peace offering.\n\n---\n\n**The Traveling Chest Challenge 7**\n\n_Medium construct_ 2,900 XP\n\n**Armor Class** 18 (natural armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 119 (14d6+70)\n\n**Speed** 50 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n18 (+4) 14 (+2) 20 (+5) 3 (–4) 14 (+2) 12 (+1)\n\n**Proficiency** +3; **Maneuver** DC 15\n\n**Damage Resistances** cold, fire; bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from nonmagical weapons\n\n**Damage Immunities** necrotic, poison, thunder\n\n**Condition Immunities** _fatigued_ , _poisoned_ \n\n**Senses** blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 12\n\n**Languages** understands but can not speak Common, Elvish\n\n**_False Appearance._** While _The Traveling Chest_ remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary chest.\n\n_**Immutable Form**_. The chest is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.\n\nACTION\n\n**_Bite._** _Melee Weapon Attack_: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8+4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is _grappled_  (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is _restrained_ , and the chest can't bite another target.\n\n_**Swallow.**_ The chest makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is _grappling_ . If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is _blinded_  and _restrained_ , it has _total cover_  against attacks and other effects outside the chest, and it begins _suffocating_  at the start of each of the chest’s turns. If the chest takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the chest regurgitates all swallowed creatures along with up to 1d10 other random items that were stored within it, all of which falls _prone_  in a space within 10 feet of the chest. If the chest dies, all swallowed creatures are no longer restrained by it, and they and any items reappear randomly in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of the destroyed chest. ",

The broom’s handle is said to have come from the first tree and the bristles stolen from a god, but its beginnings are far more humble—just a simple mundane object that accrued its first enchantment by chance after years of exposure to countless rituals. Since then its attraction to magic has grown, and so too has its admiration for the arcane. The broom has been in the hands of countless spellcasters, many of them unlikely candidates to pursue magic, though it cannot remember their names. Only the feats of magic they achieved are of any worth to the broom.\n\n_**Sentience.**_ The broom is a sentient construct with Intelligence 19, Wisdom 15, and Charisma 17\\. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The broom communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Sylvan, and Undercommon. \n\n_**Personality.**_ The broom’s purpose is to encourage the use of magic—the more powerful the better—regardless of any consequences. It is unconcerned with the goings on of mortals or anyone not engaged with magic, and it demands a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.\n\n**_Demands._** If you are unable to cast spells and attune to the broom, it relentlessly argues for you to pursue magical training and if none is achieved within a month it goes dormant in your hands (becoming a very durable stick). In addition, the broom is a repository of magic over the ages and it strongly encourages you to seek out monsters to harvest powerful reagents, explore cursed ruins in search of forbidden knowledge, and undertake precarious rituals.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with the magic broom, and when the broom deals damage with a critical hit the target is _blinded_  until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Ancient Broom_, used by spellcasters since the dawn of time.\n\n**DC 18** The broom is able to animate itself and attack your enemies, it has the power to open locks and break shackles, and it enables you to move without leaving a trace of your passing.\n\n**DC 21** Many of those who have wielded the _Ancient Broom_ came from humble and unlikely backgrounds.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Ancient Broom_ has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.\n\n**Magic**\n\nWhile you are attuned to the broom you gain an expertise die on checks made with Arcana, and while holding it you can innately cast __pass without trace_  (no _concentration_  required) and _nondetection_ at will.\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to knock the broom against a lock, door, lid, chains, shackles, or the like to open them. Once you have done so 3 times, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest. You can speak with the broom over the course of a _short rest_ , learning one ritual spell. The next time you use this feature, you forget the last spell learned from it.\n\n**Dancing Broom**\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to toss this broom into the air and cackle. When you do so, the broom begins to hover, flies up to 60 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The broom uses your _attack roll_  and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and unless a target is hidden or _invisible_  it has _advantage_  on its attack roll.\n\n While the broom hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the broom to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.\n\n The broom ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.",

A cunning historian may be able to track the cane’s origins to a certain mage under a certain authoritarian regime centuries ago, who supplied it to a figure widely known for their role in the regime’s downfall.

You can expend any number of charges from the cane to cast a chaos spell, which costs a number of charges equal to the spell’s level.

To the person approaching the book through the right means (such as refracting the text through a beer glass, reading at strange angles, or using one’s own personal genius) these notes reveal step-by-step instructions which streamline and improve the enchantments described within.

Long ago it was a desire to both bolster and renew their forces that led a mage to create a relic many would consider unthinkable: a scepter that twists the essence of life itself. With it the dead are remade into unrecognizable tangles of flesh that despite their deformity do the wielder of the scepter’s bidding, all as their allies are healed and empowered with vigor far beyond mortal bounds.\n\nThis heavy silver scepter has two heads, both cast in metal and staring out of glassy onyx eyes. One head is a skull, its jaw thrown open and its teeth unnaturally elongated. At the other end of the scepter is a cherubic human face that is turned upwards as though determined not to look at its sibling. \n\nNo one is certain whether it was the creator’s shame that led them to hide the scepter, or if their enemies cast it out of memory for fear of its power. What is known is that the legend of the _Dread Caduceus_ has endured and that whispers of its whereabouts have not been silenced by time.\n\nWhile you are attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_ you may use either end of the scepter to activate its powers.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Dread Caduceus_, a holy scepter with the power to raise the dead. \n\n**DC 18** The cherub and skull heads cause healing and necromantic effects, respectively.\n\n**DC 21** Those who use the scepter risk having their very flesh corrupted and their souls devoured.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment. \n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ warps your life energy, twisting your flesh as it corrupts that of others. While you are attuned to the scepter, your organs shift and twist, sticking to one another within you. Take 1d6 necrotic damage each dawn from this effect. This damage can only be healed by a _long or short rest_ . You also have _disadvantage_  on initiative rolls as you are distracted by this tangible shifting within.\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has 2d10 charges and regains 1d10 charges each dawn.

If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you instantly die and cannot be resurrected (even by a _wish_  spell).\n\n**Cherub**\n\nYou can use an action and expend charges from the _Dread Caduceus_ to cause one of the following effects to extend from the cherub head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 30 feet: \n\n_**Heal.**_ The creature regains 1d8+1 hit points for each expended charge. \n\n**_Healing Nimbus (3 Charges)_**.

The creature becomes immune to damage from nonmagical attacks for 1d4 rounds.\n\n_**Exhaustless (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes immune to _fatigue_  for 1d6 days.\n\n_**Resistance (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes resistant to one type of damage of your choice for 1d6 rounds. This property has no effect if the creature already has resistance to that damage type.\n\n**_Cure (10 Charges)_**. The creature is healed of any _curses_ , _diseases_ , _poisons_ , or other negative effects, even if a _wish_  spell has previously been unsuccessful.\n\n_**Invigorate (10 Charges).**_ The creature permanently increases its maximum hit points by 1d8+1\\. A creature can only benefit from this property once. \n\n**Skull**\n\nYou can use an action and expend charges from the _Dread Caduceus_ to cause one of the following effects to extend from the skull head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 100 feet: \n\n_**Animate Skeleton (1 Charge).**_ You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating the skeleton of its body to serve at your whim. The creature gains the _skeleton template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_. \n\n_**Animate Zombie (2 Charges).**_ You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating it as a zombie to serve at your whim. The creature gains the _zombie template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus._\n\n_**Empower Undead (2 Charges).**_ Choose 1d6 undead that you can see within range. Whenever one of the chosen undead makes a weapon attack it deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage. Even on a miss, the undead deals 1d4 necrotic damage.\n\n**_Animate Legion (6 Charges)._** You return 3d10 dead humanoids to a semblance of life, transforming their corpses into _zombies_ . \n\nYou can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead you create using the _Dread Caduceus._ When you command multiple undead, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete. \n\nIn addition, any creature you animate in this fashion retains injuries or disfigurements that were upon its corpse, and it continues to decompose.",

Whether summoned or drawn by hunger, the mind-bending entity crosses black seas of infinity to gorge upon mortal civilizations and gods alike.\n\nRarely in the uncounted eons of his existence, the spore of the Devouring King is denied. In this reality primordial powers drove him back before he took root, destroying him almost completely. Of his titanic form only a piece of skull, a fragment of wing membrane, and a piece of its strange heart survived. Nyth'zerogg's might was such that even these pieces contain terrible power, housing a fragment of his essence and a shard of his alien psyche.\n\nSince Nyth’Zerogg’s destruction pieces of the raiment have shown up throughout history, ultimately destroying their bearers and causing untold devastation. The destruction that they have wrought is insignificant compared to the danger that they pose however, as these artifacts hold the key to restoring the spore of Nyth’Zerogg so that he may consume all reality. The _Raiment of the Devouring King_ consists of three pieces: a cloak, a crown, and an orb. To attune to a piece, you must awaken it by pouring the blood of a recently sacrificed sapient creature onto it, allowing you to graft it to your body in a process that takes a minute, during which you are _incapacitated_  by agony. Once attuned, pieces can only be removed if you are killed.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is part of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ the remains of an ancient being who consumed worlds. \n\n**DC 18** There are three surviving pieces of the raiment: a cloak, a crown, and an orb.\n\n**DC 21** The cloak grants flight and teleportation, the crown transforms the wearer’s body, and the orb enhances their mind.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nWhile you are attuned to any piece of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ you are subject to Malignant Influence (see below) and gain the following benefits:\n\n* You cease aging and become immune to poison and disease.\n* You gain a pool of 8 charges that can be spent to fuel the _Raiment of the Devouring King’s_ magical properties (save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). You regain 1d4+1 charges each dusk.\n\n**A Complete Set**\n\nBecause of their powerful desire to be together, no matter how many pieces of the Raiment of the Devouring King you wear they count as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement. For each additional piece of the Raiment of the Devouring King that you acquire, you gain the following benefits:\n\n**_Two Pieces._** Your pool of charges increases to 12\\. You can use an action to regain 1 expended charge by messily devouring an _incapacitated_  or _unconscious_  creature within your reach, killing it in the process. Creatures slain in this manner can only be returned to life by means of a _wish_ or __true resurrection ._\n\n_**Three Pieces.**_ Your pool of charges increases to 16\\. When you take a _short rest_ , you can extend tendrils into the ground and regain 1d4+1 charges by consuming natural energy within a 1-mile radius. All plant life in the area dies and beasts become _poisoned_  while in the area. This property can only be used in an area once per decade, after which it cannot support life for the next 10 years.\n\nYou cannot be permanently killed unless each piece of the raiment is cut from your body in conjunction with a carefully worded __wish_ spell. Instead, you return to life 1d3 days later.\n\n**Cloak of the Devouring King**\n\nThis deep jade cloak resembles a large piece of torn wing membrane. When attuned, it grafts to your back, reweaving muscle and bone and turning into a single leathery wing that grants a portion of Nyth’zerogg’s vitality.\n\n While attuned to the _Cloak of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your Constitution score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if your Constitution is equal to or greater than 20.\n* You gain a fly speed equal to your Speed.\n* You regain 1d8 hit points at the beginning of each of your turns if you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, you regrow the missing part within 1d6 days.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: _longstrider_ (1 charge), __misty step_  (2 charges), __blink_ (3 charges), _dimension door_  (4 charges), __plane shift_  (5 charges), or _teleport_ (5 charges)\n\n**Crown of the Devouring King**\n\nThe alabaster crown resembles a jagged piece of flat bone affixed to a crude iron band. When worn, it settles so that a single spoke of bone extends above the wearer's eye. When you attune to the skull, it grafts with your bone and grants a portion of Nyth’zerogg’s strength.\n\nWhile attuned to the _Crown of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your Strength score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.\n* Your body transforms, turning a rubbery gray green as chitinous bone plates emerge from your skin. This counts as a suit of _1 leather_ if you are proficient with light armor, a suit of _1 breastplate_  if you are proficient with medium armor, or a suit of   _1 full plate_  if you are proficient with heavy armor. This armor does not impose _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n* You can use an action to spend 1 charge to shape chitin and bone from your body into a +1 weapon. You may only have two such weapons in existence at a time. Any ammunition needed is created as the weapon is fired. You may spend 1 charge as part of an action to deliver touch spells through a weapon created in this manner by making a single weapon attack as a part of that action. A weapon created in this manner crumbles to dust a round after it leaves your person.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: __shield_  (1 charge), __enlarge/reduce_  (2 charges), __protection from energy_ (self only; 2 charges), _stoneskin_ (self only; 3 charges).\n\n**Orb of the Devouring King**\n\nThis crimson orb resembles a massive, calcified heart suspended on a crude chain. When the orb returns to life, hooked tendrils extend and burrow into your chest, lodging it there where it grants a portion of the god’s mind and knowledge.\n\n While attuned to the _Orb of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Choose Intelligence or Charisma. The chosen ability score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if the chosen ability score is equal to or greater than 20.\n* You gain a 1d10 expertise die on Intelligence checks.\n* When you take a short rest, you can recover an expended spell slot of 6th-level or higher by spending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot recovered.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: __detect thoughts_ (1 charge)_, suggestion_ (2 charges), __black tentacles_ (3 charges), _telekinesis_  (4 charges), _dominate monster_  (5 charges).\n\n**Malignant Influence**\n\nEach piece of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ longs to be united with the others so that Nyth’Zerogg may live again. While attuned to a piece of the artifact, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom _saving throw_  once per month or gain a level of Malignant Influence, which cannot be removed while you are attuned to the _Raiment of the Devouring King._ With two pieces of the artifact attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per week, and when all three pieces of the artifact are attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per day.\n\n_**Level 1**._ You become obsessed with acquiring the other pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ and devote all of the time and resources at your disposal to the task.\n\n_**Level 2.**_ You become ravenous and must consume one living sapient being each day or gain a level of _fatigue_  that persists until you consume such a creature.\n\n_**Level 3.**_ You fall entirely under the sway of the Raiment of the Devouring King. You gain the Chaotic and Evil alignment traits, and you will stop at nothing to see Nyth’Zerogg reborn. You immediately become an NPC under the Narrator’s control.\n\n**Awakening Nyth’Zerogg**\n\nIf all three pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ graft to a single host and they acquire three levels of Malignant Influence, the host’s mind and soul are devoured as fuel for Nyth’zerogg’s reawakening. The exact consequences of such a reawakening are left to the Narrator but likely pose an extinction level threat to mortals and gods alike.\n\n**Destruction**\n\nMany attempts have been made to destroy pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ yet they always reform. Some believe that they can only be destroyed by plunging a creature with all three pieces of the artifact grafted to its body into the heart of a star or a true flame in the center of the Elemental Plane of Fire—though even this is just a theory.",

With all manner of wheels, gears, cables, and hinges, when worn its movements are surprisingly fluid, if somewhat loud and heavy.\n\nThe last of its kind, the _Serveros War Engine_ was used by a forgotten empire's soldiers in wars that spread far beyond their kingdom. It’s hard to imagine there may once have been entire armies outfitted with these magical constructs and engaged in battle against one another, and impossible to conceive of the untold destruction they wrought.\n\nMounting the war engine is a fairly straightforward matter. As you enter the construct, you can don a helm and belt, both connected to the war engine, which allow you to attune to and control the construct. The construct is not sentient and moves only when controlled in this way.\n\nWhen controlling the construct, you form a psychic bond with it, seeing through its eyes, moving with its limbs, and experiencing pain through its body.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Serveros War Engine_, the last war machine of a forgotten empire. \n\n**DC 18** The engine is piloted from inside, and only those with mental and physical fortitude can endure it. In addition to offering great might, it can manifest arcane blades, cannons, and other effects.\n\n**DC 21** Destroying the engine requires destroying the helm, which is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Serveros War Engine_ has one lesser artifact benefit. Piloting the war engine can be quite taxing, both mentally and physically. You gain no benefits from a _long or short rest_  while mounted in the war engine, and when you expend its last available charge you suffer both a level of _fatigue_  and _strife_ .\n\nWhile you are attuned to, mounted inside, and controlling the _Serveros War Engine_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your AC becomes 18.\n* Your Strength score becomes 21.\n* You are Huge-sized.\n* Your Speed becomes 40 feet.\n* You have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  made to avoid being _grappled_  or knocked _prone_ .\n* You sustain only 1 hit point of damage for every 5 hit points of nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt to you.\n* Your unarmed strikes deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage.\n* Your weapon attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.\n* You have _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n* You are vulnerable to psychic damage.\n\n**Charged Properties**\n\nThe war engine also has several built-in features, some of which are powered by stored electrical charges or drain energy from your life force.\n\n* A massive sword hilt is secured to the construct’s hip by an incredible magnetic force. You can use a bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to draw the hilt and engage its plasma blade.\n\n_**Plasma Blade**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8+5) radiant damage, or 21 (3d10+5) radiant damage if wielded in two hands.\n\n* An arcane cannon is housed in the construct’s left forearm. You can use an action or bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the arcane cannon.\n\n_**Arcane Cannon**_. _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 120/300 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (2d6) radiant damage.\n\n* The construct’s right hand is detachable. You can use an action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the gauntlet as a projectile.\n\n_**Gauntlet Grapple.**_ _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 60/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 23 (4d8+5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d6+5) bludgeoning damage and if the target is a Large or smaller creature it is _grappled_ . You can use a bonus action to retract the hand up to 120 feet and reconnect it to the construct. A grappled target moves with the hand.\n\n The _Serveros War Engine_ begins with 1d20 charges. By making a DC 18 Intelligence (Engineering) check, 2d10 charges can be restored during a _long rest_ .\n\n**Warframe Variations**\n\nThe Narrator may apply one or more of the following variant options if desired.\n\n_**Airborne.**_ You can expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to unfold magical wings and gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute.\n\n_**Disrepair.**_ When first discovered, the _Serveros War Engine_ may be completely depleted of stored charges and heavily damaged, or perhaps almost completely dismantled. With maintenance, care, and careful reconstruction using Engineering (or a wish spell), it can be restored to its full, terrible power.\n\n_**Glass Jaw.**_ When the _Serveros War Engine_ takes a critical hit from an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, roll a d20\\. On a 1, the war engine’s head is knocked off, disabling the artifact until it is repaired with a DC 23 Intelligence (Engineering) check and 8 hours of work.\n\n_**Mortal Echoes.**_ The _Serveros War Engine’s_ last pilot died while mounted within the war engine, and echoes of their psyche still linger within the construct. When first attempting to attune to the artifact, you relive the final moments of the dead pilot and make a DC 18 Charisma _saving throw_ . On a failure, you take 5 (1d10) psychic damage and gain a short-term _mental stress effect_ .\n\n**_Nautical._** You gain a swim speed of 40 feet. In addition, you can use an action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to seal the cockpit and fill it with breathable air which lasts for 1 hour.\n\n_**Recon.**_ You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet and can either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to activate magical floating discs on the soles of the construct’s feet. The discs last for 1 hour during which time the construct does not cause you to have _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and you leave no tracks on the ground.\n\n_**Serveros Slayer.**_ In lieu of the arcane cannon and detachable fist, the construct is equipped with a psyblade in each hand. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to deploy one or both psyblades. \n\n_**Psyblade.** Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) psychic damage.\n\n_**Specialized Weaponry**_. Instead of a giant plasma sword, the _Serveros War Engine_ has one of the following weapons. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to equip and activate the weapon.\n\n_**Discus Throwing Shield**. Melee_ or _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ reach 5 ft. or range 40/80 ft., one target, or if thrown two targets within 10 feet of each other. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage. In addition, while the shield is donned your AC increases by 2.\n\n_**Extendable Metal Staff**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning, or 18 (3d8+5) bludgeoning damage when wielded with two hands, and a Large or smaller target makes a DC 18 Strength _saving throw_  or is knocked _prone_ .\n\n_**Shocking Net.**_ _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 30/60 ft., all targets in a 15-foot square area. _Hit:_ 9 (2d8) lightning damage and the target is _grappled_ . At the start of your turn, conscious creatures grappled by the net take 9 (2d8) lightning damage. This weapon cannot damage a creature with 0 hit points.\n\n_**Sonic War Hammer.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 18 (3d8+5) thunder damage, or 21 (3d10+5) thunder damage when wielded with two hands.\n\n**Destroying the War Engine**\n\nOf all its various parts and components the key to disabling and ultimately destroying the war engine is the helm. The rest of the massive construct might feasibly be replaced or reengineered by an ingenious mind. However with its complex structure, both magical and mechanical, replicating the controller headpiece requires arcane knowledge and technical documentation that disappeared with the war engine’s creators long ago. \n\nThe helm is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm. Bypassing its magical protections requires two steps: first, a __dispel magic_ cast at 5th-level or higher is needed to make the invisible barrier around the war engine’s helm vulnerable for 6 seconds, followed by a __disintegrate_ spell cast at 7th-level or higher to completely dissolve the barrier. Once the barrier is dissolved, for the next 24 hours the helm can be destroyed like any other item (AC 22, 100 hit points) before its magical protections regenerate and fully repair it.",

Originally called the _Sword of All Traditions,_ over time the gems in the pommel were lost and now only three remain. Should its lost gemstones be returned, the blade might be restored to its full spectrum of glory and power.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Sword of Three Traditions,_ which grants mastery of the techniques of combat. Each of the three gemstones in its hilt represents a tradition of combat.\n\n**DC 18** The sword can transform into other weapons based on the gemstones in its hilt.\n\n**DC 21** Only a dragon of the same color can destroy the sword’s gemstones.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Sword of Three Traditions_ has two lesser artifact benefits, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. For each of the first five magical gemstones restored to the sword, it gains 1 lesser artifact benefit. For each of the last three magical gemstones restored to it, the sword gains 1 greater artifact detriment and 1 greater artifact benefit.\n\nThe _Sword of Three Traditions_ is a   _1 longsword_ . Once you are attuned, you can use an action to turn the sword into a different _1 weapon ._ In addition, when you use a combat maneuver, the sword automatically changes into the weapon associated with that tradition.

Once attuned to a magical gemstone, it bestows a minor artifact benefit. You can only attune to the magical gemstone if you know a combat maneuver from the tradition associated with it. \n\nYou can use an action to attach a magical gemstone to the sword. No matter how many magical gemstones are attached to the sword, it counts as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement.\n\nThe sword normally comes affixed with its diamond, peridot, and sapphire (for the Adamant Mountain, Rapid Current, and Razor’s Edge traditions), but the Narrator may choose to have different magical gemstones attached to it or determine them randomly. \n\nWhen the sword turns into more than one item, the +1 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  only apply to any weapons created (there are no bonuses bestowed to the ammunition or shield).

Any such item created by the sword disappears after 1 minute if it is no longer on your person, or when the sword changes shape again.\n\n The sword’s power increases when 7 gems are in its pommel (turning it into a _2 weapon_  that reduces exertion costs by 2) or when fully restored with all 11 magical gemstones (turning it into a   _3 weapon_ that reduces exertion costs by 3). \n\n__**Table: Sword of Three Traditions**__\n| **1d12** | **Tradition**       | **Weapon**                        | **Gem**    |\n| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 1        | Razor’s Edge        | Longsword                         | Diamond    |\n| 2        | Adamant Mountain    | Greatsword                        | Peridot    |\n| 3        | Rapid Current       | Two shortswords                   | Sapphire   |\n| 4        | Biting Zephyr       | Longbow and quiver with 10 arrows | Pearl      |\n| 5        | Mirror’s Glint      | Saber and light shield            | Opal       |\n| 6        | Mist and Shade      | Dagger                            | Aquamarine |\n| 7        | Sanguine Knot       | Bastard sword                     | Garnet     |\n| 8        | Spirited Steed      | Lance                             | Topaz      |\n| 9        | Tempered Iron       | Morningstar                       | Amethyst   |\n| 10       | Tooth and Claw      | Battleaxe                         | Ruby       |\n| 11       | Unending Wheel      | Rapier                            | Emerald    |\n| 12       | Adventurer’s choice | \\-                                | \\-         |\n\n### **Seekers of the Sword**\n\nThe _Sword of Three Traditions_ is sought after by power hungry and righteous warriors alike, and any search for the fabled blade is certain to cause conflict with some of the following foes.\n\n__**Table: Seekers of the Sword**__\n| **1d6** | **Adversary**                              |\n| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| 1       | _Warrior_  on training pilgrimage          |\n| 2       | Despot with a band of raiders              |\n| 3       | Master martial artist who tests the worthy |\n| 4       | Spellsword in search of secrets            |\n| 5       | Greedy _assassin_  or _thief_              |\n| 6       | Greedy _assassin_  or _thief_              |\n\n### **Destroying the Sword**\n\nThe power which binds the _Sword of Three Traditions_ is located in its magical gemstones.

        "desc": "This golden tome is a written record of the divine dance which brought the world into being. _The Song of Creation i_s eternal, meaning that it has always existed even before the words were wrought onto the page. One wonders—is the _Song of Creation_ the written word, the book, or the melody the gods sang? Somehow the _Song of Creation_ is more than this and yet they all are one. That means that in a way the _Song of Creation’s_ wielder holds the multiverse itself in their hands.\n\n**Legends and Lore Success** on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Song of Creation_, a prayer book filled with the eternal melody which brought the world into being. \n\n**DC 18** The tome can break the minds of those who read it, but it can also grant access to powerful miracles.\n\n**DC 21** The tome is completely indestructible.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Song of Creation_ has two lesser artifact benefits, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.\n\n**Mystical Tome**\n\nThis tome is written in a script that even the angels cannot decipher. While attuned to it, you can read it as though you are reading your first language. Reading the _Song of Creation_ reveals beautiful poetry about nature, light, and life, but structurally they do not make sense when read start-to-end. The poems cannot be perfectly translated, as each individual interprets the same poem differently. The pages cannot be counted, and various purported complete counts invariably disagree.  \nWhen you first attune to this tome and when you read it, you must make a DC 18 Wisdom _saving throw_  or else become _stunned_  for 1 hour. If you succeed on this saving throw, you are not subject to it again for 1 week. If you consult this tome during a Wisdom or Intelligence check to recall lore, you gain a +5 bonus to the roll, and any natural d20 results of 2 through 9 count as a 10.\n\n**Magic**\n\nWhile you use this prayer book as a spell focus, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC, and you cast the spell without the need for any other material components that cost 1,000 gold or less. In addition, you know the following spells: __astral projection , demiplane , gate , maze , true resurrection ._\n\n**Destroying the Song**\n\nThe _Song of Creation_ is made from a material that defies categorization, and it may well be indestructible.

        "desc": "Few powers are more coveted than the ability to examine and manipulate the threads of fate, and yet destiny is a mystery that most have yet to fully comprehend. As enigmatic as the forces it commands, the origins of the Veil of Fate are unknown. It was brought to historical attention when it was revealed as the source of a renowned seer’s remarkable abilities, her foretellings reached the ears of queens and generals, shaping a continent and undoubtedly the whole of history. Fearful of her influence and envious of the veil’s power, those outside of her circle of influence conspired to behead her and take the relic. The subsequent fighting and intrigue saw the Veil of Fate become lost for centuries, occasionally appearing in tales as fantastic as they were inscrutable. While this tale is the best known, records of the Veil of Fate’s existence can be traced to the beginnings of written history, its bearers painted as either titans of achievement or dire warnings to be heeded by the wise.\n\nThe Veil of Fate is a diaphanous silver and gray cloth attached to a thin silvery band which is worn on the bearer’s head. When worn correctly, it falls to the floor around its bearer, covering them entirely in a faint silver shimmer. It is unknown whether or not this appearance is due purely to the physical nature of the veil or its powers taking the bearer slightly beyond the bounds of reality.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Veil of Fate_, which allows the wearer to see the very strands of destiny. \n\n**DC 18** The veil grants glimpses into the future.\n\n**DC 21** Many who have donned the veil are immediately struck by disturbingly accurate premonitions of the future.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Veil of Fate_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. \n\nWhen you are wearing and attuned to the veil, creatures have _disadvantage_  on _opportunity attacks_  against you as the combination of your enhanced foresight and diaphanous appearance bamboozles your foes.\n\nThe glimpses of the future granted by the _Veil of Fate_ are not always advantageous. You are always last in the initiative order as you are overwhelmed with insights into the events that are about to unfold, though you may choose to use your foretelling roll (see Control Fate below) for all of your initiative checks for the day.\n\nIn addition, you can impart some of the veil’s power by falling into a deep meditation for 8 hours. When your meditation is concluded, your touch bestows one of the benefits of the _Veil of Fate_ onto an allied creature, and you suffer a level of _fatigue_  from the effort.\n\n**Foretelling**\n\nAt the Narrator’s discretion, when you first attune to the Veil of Fate you are granted a detailed premonition of future events, presenting the opportunity to intertwine those threads of fate with your own. You can perfectly recall the premonition for a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 day), after which the memory is gone as if you never experienced it. Anything you write down or otherwise record about the premonition during this time is all that remains. Another creature may be given a different premonition or no premonition upon attuning to the veil. You can occasionally recall key details of the premonition at important crossroads in the future before the depicted events occur, and otherwise receive guidance from the premonition long after you’ve forgotten it.\n\n**Choose Your Destiny**\n\nWhile attuned to the Veil of Fate you are keenly aware of your own destiny. \n\nWhen you spend 8 hours meditating on your destiny and life’s purpose, you can see some of the steps you must take to change it. This meditation brings on a profound change, and when it is concluded you may choose a new _Destiny_ .\n\n**Control Fate**\n\nWhen you finish a long rest, you are bolstered by a strange sense of how to get the most out of your interactions and endeavours, gaining inspiration.\n\nIn addition, after completing a long rest you roll a d20\\. This is your foretelling roll. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an ability check, _attack roll_ , or _saving throw_ , you may choose to replace the d20 roll with your foretelling roll. You may choose to use this property after seeing the initial roll, but before any of the roll’s effects occur. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until finishing a long rest.\n\n**Magic**\n\nYou may cast _augury_  at will while attuned to and wearing the _Veil of Fate_.\n\nTwice per _long rest_  you can cast one of the following spells without consuming material components or expending a spell slot: _arcane eye , clairvoyance , commune , divination_ .\n\nRoll a d20 after each _long rest_ . On an 18 or above, you gain the benefits of the __foresight_ spell.",

Arcane societies tend to look down upon the people that deign to use this artifact and refuse to recognize it for what it truly is, perpetuating the belief that it is a cursed relic best left alone. Any knowledgeable scholar knows there is good reason for the practice—sometimes when left idle for too long without a master the hut walks of its own accord directly towards the nearest planar portal, and all those known to have claimed ownership have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. \n\nA simple bed and table permanently affixed to the floor in this shuttered wooden hut, and it is able to fit up to 12 Medium or smaller creatures inside. After taking a _long rest_  inside of the hut, you make a DC 21 Perception check, seeing through the veil and revealing its true nature on a success—strange markings and other signs of witchcraft cover nearly every surface of the interior and it reeks of chicken effluent. Once the veil is seen through, there are 8 glowing runes on the table, each only half-illuminated. When you pass your hand over a rune, the energies inside respond and you can fully illuminate it or remove its glow entirely. When certain runes are illuminated, enormous chicken legs beneath the hut rise it up off of the ground. The _Chicken Hut_ is a Gargantuan object with an Armor Class of 21, a total of 320 hit points, Speed 50 ft. or swim 10 ft. (0 ft. if the legs aren’t extended), and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.\n\nThe hut floats on water. While the hut’s door and window shutters are closed, the interior is airtight and watertight. The interior holds enough air for 60 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nYou can use an action to control the illumination of as many as two of the hut’s runes, and a bonus action to control a third. After each use, a rune goes back to its neutral position. Each rune, from left to right, functions as shown in the Walking Chicken Hut Runes table.\n\nIf you are not attuned to any magic items and spend a week inside of the _Walking Chicken Hut_, you can attune to it. The hut uses 2 of your attunement slots. Once attuned, as long as you can see it you can use your bonus action to manipulate as many as 3 of its runes. \n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Walking Chicken Hut_, home to many wielders of magic throughout the ages. \n\n**DC 18** The hut is known to move and act of its own accord.\n\n**DC 21** The hut can be controlled using the runes on the table within.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Walking Chicken Hut_ has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.\n\n__**Table: Walking Chicken Hut Runes**__\n| **Rune** | **Lit**                                                                                                                               | **Dark**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1        | An enormous pair of chicken legs extend, allowing the hut to walk and swim.                                                           | The chicken legs retract, reducing the hut’s Speed to 0 feet and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 2        | Forward window shutter opens.                                                                                                         | Forward window shutter closes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| 3        | Side window shutters open (two per side).                                                                                             | Side window shutters close (two per side).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| 4        | Each extended chicken leg makes the following melee weapon attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

        "desc": "This crown looks like a braid of pure crystal and its front is a set of three pointed, curling spires that give its wearer an imposing, regal silhouette. Once worn by the monarch of an ancient crystal palace deep underground, the crown was lost after its wearer’s grasping schemes brought calamity on their people. The power, ambition, and ruthless might of the Crystal Sovereign of Coranaal still lingers, granting the wearer the following properties:\n\n_**Crystal Skin.**_ Your skin takes on a jagged, shimmering appearance and feels firm and cold to the touch. You gain +2 to your Armor Class. Additionally, when you’re hit by a ranged spell attack, roll 1d4\\. On a 3, you are unaffected and the spell is reflected back at its caster, rolling again to see if it hits.\n\n**_All-Seeing._** You gain truesight out to 30 feet. Additionally, you can use this trait to cast __clairvoyance_  at will, using the crown as your material component.\n\n**_Lord Under The Mountain._** Your Prestige Rating is increased by 2, or 4 if you’re underground.\n\n**_Regal Bearing._** A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier you can, as an action, target one creature that can see you within 60 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom _saving throw_  (DC = 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier) or use its next turn to fall _prone_  in supplication, taking no other actions. Additionally, when you’re targeted with any attack by a creature within 10 feet of you, you can force it to make this saving throw as a reaction. On a failure it has _disadvantage_  on the attack and then falls prone as above.\n\n**_Greed of Coronaal._** It’s said that, even as their palace crumbled, the Crystal Sovereign still coveted and guarded their treasures. You can use an action to summon an item from the hoard of Coronaal, an endlessly enormous extra dimensional space that you can access remotely. You instinctively know what’s inside, and when you first access the hoard, roll on _Treasure_  for Challenge Ratings 23-30 to determine what’s already there. This doesn’t mean that you have any desire to share, however, and must make a DC 14 Wisdom _saving throw_  to willingly part, even temporarily, with any item that has been in the hoard.\n\nYou can also use an action to touch an item of up to Large size and send it to the hoard. However, the crown shuns items it deems unworthy, casting them into the Astral Plane if you attempt to store them. This includes magic items of common or uncommon rarity and any mundane items worth less than 500 gp. Additionally, as a security feature, creatures cannot enter this space; even the wearer can only access it remotely. Otherwise, the hoard has the limitations of any other interdimensional space in regards to Supply and dead creatures. Placing another interdimensional item, such as a _portable hole_ , in the hoard destroys the lesser item, scattering its contents across the Astral Plane. Additionally, 4 (2d4) random valuables from the horde are also lost in this way, though the crown of the crystal sovereign is otherwise unaffected.\n\n_**Curse.**_ When you attune to this crown, your _Destiny_  immediately changes to _Dominion_  if it’s not already, and you can only fulfill it by reclaiming the Crystal Palace of Coronaal, which is lost to time and overtaken by creatures from the depths. You lose any existing Destiny features. In addition, if you have a chance to advance this Destiny (as determined by the Narrator) and do not take it, you lose all benefits from the crown and suffer a level of _strife_  each week until you pursue the opportunity, at which point you lose all strife gained this way and regain the benefits of the crown. These levels of strife cannot otherwise be removed.\n\nThe crown remains firmly affixed to your head and cannot be removed in any way, nor can your attunement be broken, unless you are beheaded, at which point you can never attune to the item again, even if you are brought back to life. The only other exception is if you reclaim the Crystal Palace and then choose to, in the presence of 4 sentient creatures, formally renounce your title while sitting on the throne of Coronaal, at which point the palace and crown begin to crumble, ending your attunement and destroying the item.\n\n**_Escalation._** When you fulfill this destiny, the save DC of Regal Bearing and the Armor Class bonus of Crystal Skin increase by 2, while the range of your truesight increases by 60 ft, your Prestige bonus is increased by 2, and you can cast __scrying_  at will using the crown as a focus.",

The runed weapon awaits within however, protected by the jötunn Sinmara (a _storm giant_ ) who will only exchange it for a tail feather from the golden rooster—that can only be harmed by the very same sword, creating a paradoxical task.

Odin thrust the sword it into a tree and proclaimed that anyone who pulled it from the tree would receive the sword itself as a gift, and that none had ever borne a finer blade. Sigmund drew it, only for Odin to eventually break the blade after he had used it in several battles. The two halves were bequeathed to his son, Sigurd.\n\n_Gram_ was reforged by the dwarf Regin for Sigurd in order to slay Regin’s brother, the wizard-turned-dragon, Fafnir, and reclaim a cursed treasure. Sigurd proofed the blade on Regin’s own anvil, breaking the blade again, and then again after a second forging. Finally, on the third time, it split the anvil in half with a single stroke. Sigurd later killed Fafnir by hiding in a ditch and thrusting upwards into the drake’s unprotected belly. The ditch carried away most of the dragon’s burning, poisonous blood but _Gram_, as well as Sigrud’s arm up to the shoulder, were bathed in it, and a portion of that venomous malice remains in the sword. Though Sigurd’s eventual tragic end had more to do with a cursed ring he stole from the dragon’s hoard than _Gram_, it is nevertheless known as the Sword of Grief.",

Repeating the command word or sheathing the blade extinguishes the light. Objects hit with this sword take the maximum damage the weapon’s damage dice can deal.\n\nTyrfing has 9 charges, which it does not regain while attuned to a creature. These charges are fully restored if a new creature attunes to it, but a previous bearer who attunes to the sword again only ever has the same pool of charges. When you use the sword to deal a critical hit against a creature that is not a construct or undead and has 100 or fewer hit points, it must make a DC 16 Constitution _saving throw_ . Each time a creature is killed in this manner the sword expends a charge.\n\n**_Curse._** Prior to 3 charges being expended from the blade, it will cause some tragedy or misfortune to befall you and will not expend its third charge until it has. The exact details and timing of this evil are up to the Narrator, but good examples include: causing you to automatically fail a crucial ability check (particularly one that would lead to further disaster, such as failing to identify an ally in the dark and accidentally attacking them); causing an ally who is reduced to 0 hit points to be incapable of rolling successes on death saving throws, leading to their death unless they are healed or stabilized by another creature; or causing all your next critical hits during a given combat to miss instead.\n\nMisfortune occurs again before 6 charges have been expended, and it will not expend the sixth until it has done so. Likewise, it must do so a third time before expending the final charge. If you break your attunement with Tyrfing with a pending misfortune, you remain _cursed_  until either the misfortune occurs or until you are targeted by a _remove curse_  spell cast using a 9th-level spell slot.\n\nOn expending the final charge, you must make a DC 16 constitution save. On a failure, you are slain by the sword just as surely as your opponent. On a success, you instead gain the _doomed_  condition, dying soon thereafter in a tragic manner unless powerful magic intervenes. Regardless of the result, Tyrfing then disappears. 1 week later it appears somewhere on your plane, searching for a new wielder to afflict.\n\n_Note:_ The exact mechanics of the following curse are for the Narrator and should be kept vague for players, even if they discover it is cursed. It is enough in that case for them to know Tyrfing will bring about three great evils and eventually the death of its wielder. The sword is nothing if not persistent, and attempts to leave it behind without breaking attunement merely mean that Tyrfing appears near its bearer 24 hours later.\n\n### Lore\n\nTyrfing was a sword forged under duress by the dwarves Svalinn and Durinn for Svafrlami, a king and grandson of Odin. Per his instructions, it shown with bright light, could cut through stone and steel as easily as flesh, and would never dull or rust. However, because their services were obtained under duress by threat of force, they also cursed the blade so that whenever drawn it would take a life, that it would bring about three great evils, and that it would eventually take Svafrlami’s life. This all came to pass, and the sword continued to bring disaster and ruin to each new wielder, its cursed hunger for tragedy never sated.",

When you and another creature attune to the rings, you each gain the ability to sense your approximate distance from one another. You also receive a slight jolt when the other ring wearer drops to 0 hit points.\n\nWhen the other ring wearer takes damage, you can use your reaction to concentrate and rotate the ring. When you do so, both you and the other ring wearer receive an image of an elderly herald giving up her life to shield her cleric companion from enemy arrows. The effect, spell, or weapon’s damage dice are rolled twice and use the lower result. After being used in this way, the energy in each ring disappears and they both become mundane items.",

        "desc": "A legend of ruination and wonder to those that have heard of it, the _Deck of Many Things_ is the fickle power of fate distilled. Most were created by gods of luck and are found in small and ornately carved coffers and have only 13 cards, but some have the full 22\\. The Narrator may decide, or roll 1d4 to determine randomly (a partial deck on a 1–3, or a full deck on a 4).\n\nBefore drawing, you must declare the number of cards that you intend to draw. A modified poker deck can be used to create your own physical deck using the substitutions below. A card's magic takes effect as soon as it is drawn. Once you begin drawing, each subsequent card must be drawn within an hour of the card that came before it. Failure to do so causes all of your remaining draws to fly out of the deck and take effect immediately. Once a card is drawn, if it is not a joker it is reshuffled into the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\nOnce you have drawn the number of cards that you’ve declared, the deck resets and you may never draw from that deck again. Once all individuals present when the deck is discovered have drawn their cards, roll 1d4\\. On a 1–3 the deck vanishes, or on a 4 it returns to its coffer, allowing you to transport it should you so choose.\n\nThe Balance, Comet, Donjon, Fates, Fool, Gem, Idiot, Talons, and Vizier cards only appear in the 22 card deck.\n\n---\n\n♣ **Ace of Clubs: Talons.** Every magical item that you own is immediately destroyed. Artifacts are not destroyed and are instead cast into the multiverse.\n\n♣ **King of Clubs: Void.** Your soul is torn from your body and trapped in an object in a location of the Narrator’s choosing where it is guarded by powerful beings. While your soul is trapped, your body is incapacitated. Even a _wish_ cannot restore your soul, but it can reveal its location. Any remaining draws from the deck are lost.\n\n♣ **Queen of Clubs: Flames.** You gain the enmity of a powerful devil. It seeks to destroy you along with all that you love or have built, inflicting as much misery upon you and your loved ones as possible before finally slaying you. This antagonism lasts until either you or the devil perish.\n\n♣ **Jack of Clubs: Skull.** A merciless harbinger of death appears and attempts to slay you. The harbinger appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet and immediately attacks. A sense of mortal dread fills any allies present, warning them to stay away. The harbinger fights until you die or it is reduced to 0 hit points. It cannot be harmed by anyone other than you, and if anyone other than you attempts to harm it, another harbinger of death is summoned for them. Creatures slain by a harbinger cannot be restored to life by any means.\n\n♣ **Two of Clubs: Idiot.** Your Intelligence score is permanently reduced by 1d4+1, to a minimum of 1\\. You may draw one additional card beyond what you declared.\n\n♦ **Ace of Diamonds: Vizier.** At any point within a year of drawing this card, you may ask a question while meditating and immediately receive a truthful answer that helps you to solve a problem or dilemma as well as the wisdom and the knowledge to apply it.\n\n♦ **King of Diamonds: Sun.** You gain 50,000 XP, and a randomly determined wondrous item appears in your hands.\n\n♦ **Queen of Diamonds: Moon.** You are granted 1d3 wishes (as the __wish_ spell).\n\n♦ **Jack of Diamonds: Star.** Increase an ability score of your choice by 2\\. The score cannot exceed 24.\n\n♦ **Two of Diamonds: Comet.** Defeating the next hostile monster or group of monsters alone will grant you enough experience points to advance to the next level.\n\n♥ **Ace of Hearts: Fates.** You are granted the ability to reweave the fabric of reality, allowing you to circumvent or erase a single event as though it had never happened. You may use this ability immediately upon drawing the card or at any point prior to your death.\n\n♥ **King of Hearts: Throne.** You are granted proficiency in the Persuasion skill and gain a 1d6 expertise die on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks. You are also granted legal domain over a small keep or fortress on the plane that your character inhabits. Your new domain is overrun by monsters and must be liberated before it can be inhabited.\n\n♥ **Queen of Hearts: Key.** A magic weapon of at least rare rarity that you are proficient with appears in your hand. The weapon is chosen by the Narrator.\n\n♥ **Jack of Hearts: Knight.** A _veteran_  appears and offers you their service, believing it to be destiny, and will serve you loyalty unto death. You control this character.\n\n♥ **Two of Hearts: Gem.** You are showered in wealth. A total of 25 trinkets, easily portable pieces of art, or jewelry worth 2,000 gold each, or 50 gems worth 1,000 gold each appear directly in front of you. \n\n♠ **Ace of Spades: Donjon.** You vanish and are trapped in an extradimensional space. You are either unconscious in a sphere (50%) or trapped in a nightmare realm drawn from your own experiences and fears (50%). You remain in your prison until you are freed. While divination magics cannot locate you, a wish spell reveals the location of your prison. You cannot draw any more cards.\n\n♠ **King of Spades: Ruin.** All nonmagical wealth that you own is lost. Material items vanish. Property and other holdings are lost along with any documentation. You are destitute.\n\n♠ **Queen of Spades: Euryale.** You are _cursed_  by the card. You suffer a permanent –2 penalty to all _saving throws_ . Only a god or the Fates Card can end this curse.\n\n♠ **Jack of Spades: Rogue.** A trusted ally, friend, or other NPC (chosen by the Narrator) becomes a bitter enemy, although their identity is not revealed. They will act against you based upon their abilities and resources, and will try to utterly destroy you. Only a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility. \n\n♠ **Two of Spades: Balance.** Your history rewrites itself. You gain a randomly determined background, replacing your background feature with the new background feature. You do not change the skill proficiencies or ability score increases from your previous background, or gain new skill proficiencies or ability score increases.\n\n🃏 **Joker with Trademark: Fool.** You lose 10,000 xp and must immediately draw again. If the experience lost in this manner would cause you to lose a level, you are instead reduced to the beginning of your current level instead.\n\n🃏 **Joker without Trademark: Jester.** Fortune smiles on the foolish. Either gain 10,000 XP or draw twice more from the deck beyond what you declared.\n\n---\n\n**Harbinger of Death Challenge** —\n\n_Medium undead_ 0 XP\n\n**Armor Class** 20\n\n**Hit Points** half the hit point maximum of its summoner\n\n**Speed** 60 ft., fly 60 ft.

It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.\n\n_**Turning Immunity**_. The harbinger is immune to features that turn undead.\n\nACTIONS\n\n**_Reaping Scythe_**. The harbinger sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. The sixth time and each subsequent time that a creature is damaged by this attack, it makes a DC 14 Charisma _saving throw_  or becomes _doomed_ .",

Choose one 1st-level spell that has a casting time of 1 action from any class spell list. Before the end of your next turn, you can cast this spell without the need for material components.

You can use an action to direct the boat to turn up to 90 degrees. Up to 32 medium creatures and their equipment can travel comfortably on the boat (Large creatures count as 4 creatures and Huge creatures count as 8 creatures).

When the effect ends, the token disappears.

The token transforms into a floating whip that you can command by using a bonus action, making it move up to 20 feet and attack a creature up to 10 feet away from it. The whip has an attack bonus of +10 and deals 1d6+6 force damage.

Removing a horn requires an action and the weapons disappear when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates terror in a 30-foot radius while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the area makes a DC 15 Wisdom _saving throw_  or becomes _frightened_  of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, returning it to an inert and inactive state.\n\n__**Table: Ioun Stones**__\n| **Type**           | **Rarity** | **Cost**  | **Crafting Components**                                                               | **Property**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Absorption         | Very rare  | 10,000 gp | Refined negative energy                                                               | While this white marble sphere orbits your head, when a creature you can see casts a spell of 4th-level or lower targeting only you, you can use your reaction to have the stone harmlessly absorb the spell, suffering no damage or negative effects.

This radiant indigo prism encases a pearl and can store spells for later use. The stone can hold up to 3 spell levels and is typically found with 1d4 – 1 levels of stored spells. To store a spell in the stone, a creature must cast a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell while holding it. The spell is drawn into the stone with no other effect. If there aren’t enough available levels to hold a spell, it cannot be stored. While the stone is orbiting you, you can cast any spell stored in it using the appropriate action. The spell uses the spell level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the creature that stored the spell, but you are considered to be the caster. Once a spell is cast, it is no longer stored. |\n| Strength           | Very rare  | 15,000 gp | Canine teeth from an awakened bear                                                    | While this bright pink pentagonal trapezohedron orbits your head your Strength score is increased by 2 (to a maximum of 20).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Sustenance         | Rare       | 525 gp    | Honeycomb from a giant bee beehive                                                    | While this delicate amber spindle orbits your head, when taking a long rest you can roll a d20\\.
