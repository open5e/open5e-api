You then touch a construct; it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or your allies are fighting the construct, it has advantage on the saving throw. Even constructs that are immune to charm effects can be affected by this spell.\n\nWhile the construct is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as, “Attack the ghouls,” “Block the bridge,” or, “Fetch that bucket.” If the construct completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends itself.\n\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the construct takes only the actions you specify and does nothing you haven’t ordered it to do. During this time, you can also cause the construct to use a reaction, but doing this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\n\nEach time the construct takes damage, it makes a new Constitution saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.\n\nIf the construct is already under your control when the spell is cast, it gains an Intelligence of 10 (unless its own Intelligence is higher, in which case it retains the higher score) for 4 hours.

This effectively paralyzes a creature that is made of metal or that is wearing metal armor with moving pieces; for example, scale mail would lock up because the scales must slide across each other, but a breastplate would be unaffected. Limited movement might still be possible, depending on how extensive the armor is, and speech is usually not affected. Metal constructs are paralyzed. An affected creature or construct can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

On a successful save, it becomes immune to this casting of the spell.\n\nAn affected creature can’t take reactions and rolls a d10 at the start of its turn to determine its behavior for that turn.\n\n| D10 | EFFECT |\n|-|-|\n| 1–2 | The creature is affected as if by a slow spell until the start of its next turn. |\n| 3–5 | The creature is stunned until the start of its next turn. |\n| 6–8 | The creature’s current initiative result is reduced by 5. The creature begins using this new initiative result in the next round. Multiple occurrences of this effect for the same creature are cumulative. |\n| 9–10 | The creature’s speed is halved (round up to the nearest 5-foot increment) until the start of its next turn. |\n\nYou can move the temporal vortex 10 feet each round as a bonus action. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n",
