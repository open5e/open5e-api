    "name": "Skysail",
    "desc": "These bat-like wings affixed to a pole are constructed out of either bone and leather or wood and cloth. While these wings are opened and the rung of the pole stepped into, you can use an action to cast _levitate_ on yourself at will.\nAdditionally, you can use an action to cast _fly_ on yourself for up to 1 minute (no concentration required). The _fly_ spell ends if you lose physical contact with the skysail. You cannot use this ability again until you complete a long rest, or you (and the Skysail) are immersed in extremely powerful air elemental magic, such as within the Elemental Plane of Air. When not in use, these wings can be easily folded together and worn beneath a cloak, and the pole used as a quarterstaff.",
