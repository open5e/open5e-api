When an ala enters a house in human form, the whole building groans in protest, as if it had been struck by a powerful stormwind.  \nAlas live in the hollows of trees that were struck by lightning. They are most active when thunder rocks the forest, and when they travel hail or thunderstorms spawn around them.  \n**Enormous Appetites.**The huge-mouthed alas have voracious appetites. In the wild, they devour wolves, bears, and badgers. They prefer to hunt in settled areas, however, because they favor the taste of innocents above all else. Unsavory tribes of savage humanoids may beg an ala’s favor (or divert its wrath) with gifts of bound captives.  \n**Energized by Storms.** In battle, an ala is constantly on the move, weaving between foes like the wind. It tears at its foes with claws and a poisonous bite, or throws wicked lightning bolts and hailstorms from afar.

Their reptilian bodies are scaly, but their wings sprout greenish-yellow feathers.  \n**Swooping and Swift.** They are surprisingly maneuverable in spite of their size, able to change direction suddenly and make deadly hit-and-run strikes. They swoop in and out of combat, snapping at targets with their needlelike teeth and striking with their envenomed stingers. Once a foe is poisoned and injured, they hover closer in a tightly packed, flapping mass of fangs, battering wings, and jabbing stingers.  \n**Strength in Flocks.** Despite their fighting ability, amphipteres are not particularly brave. Most often, they tend to lurk in small flocks in dense foliage, where they can burst forth in a flurry of wings when prey comes within view. They display surprising cunning and tenacity in large groups; they may harass foes for minutes or hours before closing in for the kill."

Their victims are constricted until their struggles cease and then are devoured. Their flexible tentacles are ill-suited for terrestrial movement; they must drag themselves clumsily across open ground too wide to swing across.  \n**Clans in the Canopy.** Arboreal grappler tribes build family nests decorated with bones and prized relics of past hunts. These nests are built high in the jungle canopy, typically 80 feet or more above the ground. Clans of 40 or more spread across crude villages atop the trees; in such large settlements, a third of the population are juveniles. These nests are difficult to spot from the ground; a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check is required. A creature observing an arboreal grappler as it climbs into or out of a nest has advantage on the check.  \n**Carnivorous Elf Hunters.** Grapplers are carnivorous and prefer humanoid flesh, elves in particular. Some suggest this arises from hatred as much as from hunger, a cruel combination of fascination and revulsion for the walking limbs of humanoid creatures."

The creature sifts through the muck and silt, extracting substances that enhance its oily secretions. If anything disturbs the creature during its languorous bathing sessions, it angrily retaliates. Once a bagiennik has bathed for four hours it seeks a target for mischief or charity.  \n**Unpredictable Moods.** One never knows what to expect with a bagiennik. The same creature might aid an injured traveler one day, smear that person with corrosive, acidic oil the next day, and then extend tender care to the burned victim of its own psychotic behavior. If the creature feels beneficent, it heals injured animals or even diseased or injured villagers. If a bagiennik visits a settlement, the ill and infirm approach it cautiously while everyone else hides to avoid provoking its wrath. When a bagiennik leaves its bath in an angry mood, it raves and seeks out animals or humanoids to spray its oil onto. If a victim drops to 0 hit points, the foul-tempered bagiennik applies healing oil to stabilize them, grumbling all the while.  \n**Acid Oils.** Collecting a dead bagiennik’s black oils must be done within an hour of the creature’s death. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check yields one vial of acid, or two vials if the result was 20 or higher. A bagiennik can use these chemicals either to heal or to harm, but no alchemist or healer has figured out how to reproduce the healing effects. Other than their acidic effect, the secretions lose all potency within moments of being removed from a bagiennik. A bagiennik weighs 250 lb., plus a coating of 20 to 50 lb. of mud and muck."

They celebrate with great passion and are quick to explosive anger.

A bone crab’s spiny, ivory-white legs blend in perfectly with bones and pale driftwood. When lacking bones, these crabs gnaw cavities into chunks of driftwood or coral to make a shelter, cementing bits of shell and debris to their portable homes. All crabs fight over choice skulls.  \n**Scavengers of Memory.** Bone crabs are voracious scavengers. They live in seaside crags and coves, where they use their specialized chelae to crack open skulls and feast on the brains. Centuries of such feeding have given bone crabs a collective intelligence. Some crabs retain fragments of memory from those they devour, and these crabs recognize friends or attack the foes of those whose skulls they wear.  \nBone crabs hunt in packs, preying on seabirds and creatures stranded in tidal pools. They drag aquatic prey above the high tide line and leave it to fester in the hot sun. They pick corpses clean in a few hours, so their hunting grounds are littered with cracked and sun-bleached bones—the perfect hiding place for these littoral predators.  \n**White Ghost Shivers.** Because they eat carrion, bone crabs carry a dangerous disease—white ghost shivers, which wrack victims with fever and delirium. Sailors and others who eat a bone crab’s unwholesome, diseased flesh rarely survive it. Although bone crabs cannot be domesticated, they can be convinced to nest in particular areas, attacking intruders while ignoring the area’s regulars."

They resemble their creators in the most obvious ways, with the same number of limbs and basic features, but all broodikens stand one foot tall with overly large heads and heavily fanged mouths. Those born to monstrous humanoids with wings or horns have ineffective, decorative versions that do not help the creature fly or fight.  \n**Emotional Echoes.** Broodikens have little personality of their own and respond to their creators’ emotions, growling when their creators feel anger and babbling happily when their creators feel joy. When their creators are more than 100 feet away, they cry loudly with a sound that resembles children of the creator’s own species. If discovered crying by anyone other than their creator, they attack. When their creators focus their anger on specific individuals, the broodikens attack as a group, using Stealth to get close and overwhelm single opponents.  \n**Born With Daggers.** Broodikens are created by eating the heart of a dead broodiken. Once this “seed” is consumed, 2d4 broodikens grow inside of the “mother” or creator. Nurturing the growing brood requires consuming specific muds, ashes, and plants, which cost 50 gp/day for each incubating broodiken. The incubation period requires one month and takes a toll on the creator’s health. During this time, the creator becomes fatigued after four hours without eight hours’ rest.  \nIf the creator is not a spellcaster, a spellcaster who meets the requirements below must supervise the incubation and birth. Most spellcasters birth the broodiken using a dagger before the broodiken tears its way out. A “mother” can only control one brood of broodiken at a time. Incubating a second brood makes the first brood furiously jealous, and it will turn on its own creator.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A broodiken doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

While not amphibious, the creature can hold its breath for minutes at a time as it lurks under the surface in wait for fresh meat.  \n**Enormous Roar.** A ravenous bukavac lives to hunt and devour prey, preferring intelligent prey to animals, and usually ambushes its victims. Due to its size, the beast must find deep ponds or lakes to hide in, but it can flatten itself comfortably to rest in two feet of water. It leads with its wicked horns before grabbing hold of its target or another nearby foe and hanging on as it claws its victim to death. The creature relishes the feel of its victim’s struggles to escape its embrace and reserves its roar, which sounds like a cross between a toad’s croak and lion’s roar emanating from a creature the size of a dragon, for organized foes or against overwhelming numbers. If a bukavac’s devastating sonic attack routs its foes, it picks off remaining stragglers; otherwise, it retreats to its underwater hiding spot.  \n**Clamorous Mating.** Solitary hunters by nature, bukavacs pair up briefly in the spring. Male bukavacs travel to a female’s lair and demonstrate their prowess by unleashing their most powerful bellows. Villages ten miles away from the lair often hear these howls for a week and pray that the creatures don’t attack. Once mating has been completed (and groves of trees have been destroyed), the female finds a secluded, shallow lake in which to bury eggs. A bukavac reaches maturity in five years, during which time it and its siblings hunt together. After the bukavacs mature, each finds its own lair.  \nA bukavac is 11 feet long, including its foot-long horns, stands four feet tall, and weighs 4,000 lb. The creature has a natural lifespan of 40 years, but its noise and proclivity to ambush intelligent prey attracts the attention of hunting parties, which considerably shorten its life expectancy."

They are omnivorous, eating roots, berries, insects, and reptiles—and they consider snakes a particular delicacy. The most advanced burrowling towns set up rudimentary farms, where they grow the fruits and vegetables they usually find in the wild.  \n**Safe Warrens.** Some towns have domesticated prairie dogs, which burrowlings train to stand watch alongside their masters. Pairs of adults stand watch around the town perimeter and sound a warning when they spot a foe. An alerted town retreats to the safety of its warrens, while the strongest creatures add more tunnels if necessary, and close access from the surface until the threat has passed. In combat, burrowlings stand together in defense of the helpless young and fight with crude slings or their sharp teeth and claws.  \n**Die of Loneliness.** If separated from its coterie, a burrowling becomes despondent, crying for others of its kind. A lone burrowling usually dies of loneliness within a week, unless it can find its way back to its town or discover another burrowling town. Rarely, a solitary creature makes its way to a non-burrowling settlement where it attempts to assist its new community. This frustrates the creature and those it interacts with as it tries to anticipate what its companions want. It may join an adventuring party in the hope of returning to a settlement. After spending at least six months with a party, the burrowling can use its Burrow Tactics ability with its new allies.  \nBurrowlings live up to 15 years. Twice a year, a burrowling female bears a litter of up to three pups, but in especially dangerous regions, the creatures breed prodigiously to keep their population ahead of massive attrition. In cases like this, a female has a litter of five pups every other month. A burrowling pup reaches adulthood in a year."

Once a creature is pinned, the cactid’s spines siphon off the victim’s bodily fluids, until little but a dried husk remains. Many cactids are adorned with bright flowers or succulent fruit to lure prey into reach. Some scatter shiny objects within reach to attract sentient creatures. For those traveling the desert, however, a cactid’s greatest treasure is the water stored within its flesh. A slain cactid’s body yields four gallons of water with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. Failure indicates that only one gallon is recovered.  \n**Slow Packs.** Cactids were created by a nomadic sect of druids, but their original purpose is lost. They have limited mobility, so they often congregate in stands or to travel together in a pack to better hunting grounds."

The air around them singed the nostrils with the taint of acid._  \n**Beasts of Burden and War.** Carrion beetles are powerful beasts of burden with strong jaws and the ability to both climb and burrow. With a wide back, serrated, spiky forelegs, and a narrow head, the carrion beetle is too large to ride on very comfortably although it makes an excellent platform for ballistae and howdahs. Its thick exoskeleton varies from drab brown, tan, and black to shimmering blue green, purple-green, and a highly prized yellow‑orange.  \nThe largest carrion beetles make a distinctive wheezing sound when their spiracles are stressed; this noise creates a hum when multiple beetles run or charge on the field of battle. War beetles are often armored with protective strips of metal or chitinous armor fused to their exoskeletons, increasing their natural armor by +2 while reducing their speed to 20 feet.  \n**Devour Fungi and Carrion.** Carrion beetles rarely gather in groups larger than a breeding pair and a small cluster of offspring in the wild. The domesticated varieties travel in herds of 20-40 to feed on fungal forests, scavenge battlefields, or devour cave lichen and scour sewage pits. The larger caravan beetles are always antagonistic.  \nWhen breeding season hits, carrion beetles feast on the bodies of large animals. They are often found in symbiotic relationships with deathcap mycolids, darakhul, and related species. Many species in the deep underworld consider carrion beetles food and use their exoskeletons to fashion shields and armor (though their chitin is too brittle for weaponry).  \nPurple worms are their major predators. Worms swallow entire caravans when they find the beetles within.  \n**Domesticated by Ghouls.** Domesticated by the darakhul, the carrion beetles live a more complex life. They begin as simple pack animals, with the strongest being trained as war beetles. War beetles often carry ballistae and harpoons fitted with lines for use against flying foes.  \nIn late life, the beetles are used as excavators, scouring out tunnels with their acid. After death, their exoskeletons are used both as animated scouting vehicles (ghouls hide within the shell to approach hostile territory) and as armored undead platforms packed with archers and spellcasters."

Its spores germinate in the carcasses of its victims, and in lean times, these spores can grow, albeit slowly, on guano or other areas rich in moisture and organic nutrients.  \n**Rare Colonies.** If a cave system has no true protectors and food is plentiful, these creatures congregate—most commonly, in bat colonies of millions of individuals. When they gather this way, cavelight mosses function as a large colony, covering strategic locations where prey roams. When a source of food moves on, the entire colony slowly disperses as well."

Many served as shock troopers in unfathomable wars between angels and fiends or gods and ancient titans. Most were lost between seconds or abandoned to drift aimlessly in the Astral Plane or in the void between the stars.  \n**Stewards of Calamity.** Locations of historical significance— both past and future—attract chronalmentals. They have a fondness for battlefields and other sites of strife. Because they are drawn to noteworthy places, chronalmentals have a reputation as harbingers of calamity, and their presence may incite panic among scholars, priests, and sages.  \n**Environmental Chaos.** Whatever the terrain, the environment behaves strangely around the chronalmental. Collapsed walls might suddenly rise, seedlings become massive trees, and fallen soldiers relive their dying moments. These changes occur randomly, a side-effect of a chronalmental’s presence, and things return to normal when they depart.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A chronalmental does not require air, food, drink, or sleep."

        "desc": "_The cikavak is a remarkably ugly magical bird—a supernatural creature conjured through a lengthy ritual. A dark gray comb flops atop their heads and shapeless wattles dangle from their throats. They seem unimposing._  \n**Dagger Beaks.** Cikavaks use their elongated, dull-gray beaks to draw up nectar and other fluids—or to stab with the force of a dagger. Although it requires great effort to call up these homely birds, the magic is surprisingly common, known among peasants and townsfolk as well as mages. Once summoned, they remain faithful to their masters until death. While cikavaks don’t speak, they comprehend the Common tongue and can speak with animals to help their master. They often magically silence the cries of more melodious birds.  \n**Potion Pouches.** Cikavaks possess another odd ability: when fully distended, their ventral pouches hold up to half a gallon of almost any liquid. These resilient pouches take little or no damage from their contents, holding potions without ingesting them or even carrying acid without injury.  \nThieves make use of this ability, directing the birds to siphon up liquids and thus steal honey from neighbors’ beehives, as well as milk, beer, and wine. The most audacious thieves send their birds into magicians’ towers, alchemists’ shops, or the local apothecary to seize mercury, phlogiston, and more exotic substances. They carry these stolen fluids back to their owner in their pouches. While normally strong flyers, when laden with liquids, their flight is clumsy at best.  \n**Folk Conjuration.** To call a cikavak with folk magic rituals, a character must gather an egg from a black hen as well as 30 gp worth of herbs and colored chalks. Cast at sunset, the folk ritual requires half an hour and requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to succeed. (The material components can be used multiple times, until the ritual succeeds). The hen’s egg must then be carried and kept warm for 40 days. During this time, the ritual caster must not bathe or be subject to any spell effects. Usable only by non-casters, the ritual’s feeble magic is immediately dispelled if the cikavak’s master uses any other sort of spell or spell-like ability."

Their masters may vary, but the clockwork huntsmen still perform when called upon. In some places they operate only on the command of the secret police, hunting down persons of interest wanted for questioning.  \nHuntsmen may operate alone, but usually they seek their quarry as a small group of two or three. Because they are unsleeping and tireless, few can hide from them for long without magical assistance.  \n**Despised Machines.** Clockwork huntsmen are painted matte black with mithral trim, and occasionally outfitted with armor or a black steel blade for added intimidation. Common folk detest them; all but their keepers and commanders shun them.  \n**Obedient to Orders.** Bound with specific instructions, clockwork huntsmen patrol, stand sentry, or remain unmoving as ordered, always paying attention, always alert to their surroundings. Clockwork huntsmen are unrelenting and single-minded in their missions, focusing on particular targets—priests, spellcasters, or heavily armored intruders, as directed. Oblivious to injury, clockwork huntsmen attack until destroyed or ordered to stand down.  \nClockwork huntsmen stand nearly six feet tall and weigh 400 lb.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork huntsman doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

If the creature hit with the shadow stealing ray flees the encounter, it is without a natural shadow for 1d12 days before the undead shadow fades and the creature's natural shadow returns. The undead shadow steals the body of its creature of origin if that creature is killed during the encounter; in that case, the creature's alignment shifts to evil and it falls under the command of the psoglav. The original creature regains its natural shadow immediately if the undead shadow is slain. A creature can only have its shadow stolen by the shadow stealing ray once per day, even if hit by the rays of two different psoglav demons, but it can be knocked back by it every time it is hit.",

Unfortunately for mortals, rebezahls can count startlingly fast; even a mound of gravel takes no more than a few moments for a rubezahl to assess.

They are given a measure of unlife by a vile ritual involving immersion in Abyssal flesh vats and invocations to the relevant demon lords. They feed on the skin of living beings to replenish their own constantly rotting skin. Their acidic saliva acts as a paralytic poison and leaves ugly scars on those who survive an attack.  \n**Cliff and Dungeon Dwellers.** Skin bats prey on the unwary but do not develop sinister plots of their own. Their flocks can be encountered in isolated areas accessible only by flight or by climbing treacherous cliffs. Skin bats can exist in any climate. In cool climes, they feed only infrequently, because the cold preserves their forms and reduces the need to replenish decaying flesh. This also explains why they are attracted to the dark depths of ageless dungeons. In wet, tropical climes where their skin decomposes rapidly, skin bats are voracious feeders by necessity.  \n**Accidental Treasures.** Skin bats have no use for magic items or wealth, but occasionally a ring or necklace from a past victim gets embedded in their fleshy folds, where it becomes an unintended trophy.  \nThe typical skin bat has an 8-foot wingspan. The color of their skin matches that of their prey, so a skin bat’s coloration can change over time. A skin bat weighs about 15 lb.  \n**Undead Nature.** A skin bat doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

A chort wants its victim to know it is dealing with a devil. The relative straightforwardness of this approach enables the creature to better deceive those whom it bargains with. After all, the chort affirms, if the victim weren’t so desperate, he wouldn’t be bargaining with a devil. If necessary, an implied threat of immolation gives it greater bargaining power, but the creature is careful not to torture or otherwise harm its patsy, since that voids any potential contract.  \n**Recitation of Contracts.** An annual spectacle in large cities involves some poor fool who believes he can trick a chort and escape a legal bargain. The devil appears and recites the entirety of the contract its victim signed, replete with embarrassing details about a dispatched rival, the ensnarement of a love who once spurned him, and other disclosures. A chort ensures all those entangled in its victim’s affairs are present to hear it, and it disappears once all the victim's dark secrets have been revealed.  \n**Smear Tactics.** A zealous opponent of the chort often finds himself the victim of his own hubris, as the devil digs up or creates vile tales about its foe and brings his folly to light. A chort enjoys tarnishing the reputation of tools of good. For example, it may steal a paladin’s sword and use it to murder an especially pious person, leaving the sword in the victim. Thus, a chort dispatches a foe strongly resistant to its manipulations, brings suspicion to another potential foe, and taints a weapon—at least in reputation—which might be used against it."

Practitioners of the dark arts know these devils as the Lords of Distortion, for their ability to practice deceit. They prize reality-warping magic above all else, and bribes of that sort can win concessions when making a pact.  \n**Surrounded by Lessers.** Orobas devils gather lesser devils both as chattel and defense. Their analytical minds telepathically confer the strengths and weaknesses of foes to their allies. With surprising speed, the deceivers can assess a battlefield, weigh outcomes, and redirect forces. Enemies of the orobas almost never catch them off guard. They have frequent, clear visions of their immediate future."

These creatures are rare but tenacious. A dissimortuum obeys orders from the necromancer whose magic created it.  \nWhen a dissimortuum kills, it collects body parts from its victims and keeps them in a sack that it carries with its third arm at all times. The monster sets down its sack of trophies only when pressed in combat, to make the most of its extra limb.  \n**Constructing Dissimortuum.** Even when not following instructions, a dissimortuum seeks to create more of its own kind. The creature wanders graveyards, battlefields, and slums, searching for the gruesome components it needs to construct a mask and body for its undead offspring. The process is slow, taking up to a month to make a single mask, but a dissimortuum has nothing but time. The new creation is independent and not under the control of its maker.  \n**Donning the Mask.** The mask of a dissimortuum is nigh indestructible. When the creature is destroyed, its mask usually survives and breaks free. On its own, the object detects as magical with mixed enchantment and necromantic auras. It is a tempting souvenir, but anyone foolish enough to don the mask is immediately wracked by pain and takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The character must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become dominated by the mask. The domination arrives slowly. The character acts normally for a day or two, but then the character notices periods of time that cannot be accounted for. During these times, the character gathers the grisly components needed to build a new body for the dissimortuum. This process takes a week, after which the character is freed from domination as the undead creature is reborn."

Its incisors are the length of shortswords.  \n**Living Siege Engines.** Derro use dogmole juggernauts as mounts and improvised siege engines, smashing through bulwarks and breaking up dwarven battle lines. When not at war, derro enjoy pitting rabid juggernauts against one another in frenzied gladiatorial contests."

They claim miles of cave networks as their own. Depending on the depth of their domain, some consider the surface world their territory as well, though they visit only to eliminate potential rivals.  \nLarge vertical chimneys, just big enough to contain the beasts, make preferred ambush sites for young cave dragons. Their ruff spikes hold them in position until prey passes beneath.  \nDue to the scarcity of food in their subterranean world, a cave dragon’s hoard may consist largely of food sources: colonies of bats, enormous beetles, carcasses in various states of decay, a cavern infested with shriekers, and whatever else the dragon doesn’t immediately devour.  \nCave dragons are especially fond of bones and items with strong taste or smell. Vast collections of bones, teeth, ivory, and the shells of huge insects litter their lairs, sorted or arranged like artful ossuaries.  \nCave dragons have no permanent society. They gather occasionally to mate and to protect their eggs at certain spawning grounds. Large vertical chimneys are popular nesting sites. There, the oldest cave dragons also retreat to die in peace. Stories claim that enormous treasures are heaped up in these ledges, abysses, and other inaccessible locations.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action for one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained (by fallen debris); damage is halved and the creature is not restrained if it makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The creature is freed when it or an adjacent ally uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.\n* A ten foot-wide, ten foot-long crack opens in the cavern floor where the dragon wishes. Any creature occupying that space must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 20 feet, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (3d4) piercing damage from the jagged stones at the bottom.\n* The dragon summons a swarm of insects as if it had cast insect plague, filling a 20-foot radius sphere within 90 feet of the dragon. Creatures that are in the affected space or that enter it take 22 (4d10) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw. The swarm lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary cave dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Poisonous and odorless gases suddenly fill passages and caverns, and just as quickly disperse, within six miles of the dragon’s lair.\n* Flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within six miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.\n* Swarms of vermin within one mile of the lair increase in both size and number as they try to escape the dragon’s endless and undiscriminating hunger.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days."

Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._  \nThe flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse often used by the foolish.  \n_**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.  \n_**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.  \n_**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.  \nNothing is safe from a flame dragon’s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.  \n\n## Flame Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nFlame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.  \nMany of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n* The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can’t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.\n* A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary flame dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.\n* Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.\n* Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon’s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they’re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days.

Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._  \nThe flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. “May you be the fire’s plaything” is a curse often used by the foolish.  \n_**Taunting Others.**_ The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasure—direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler’s ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.  \n_**Malevolent Purpose.**_ The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon’s land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.  \n_**Fond of Souvenirs.**_ Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.  \nNothing is safe from a flame dragon’s endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon’s undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon’s death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.  \n\n## Flame Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nFlame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.  \nMany of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n* The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and trapped in the ground. A creature trapped in this way is restrained and can’t stand up. A creature can end the restraint if it or another creature takes an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check.\n* A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time each turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (6d6) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary flame dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.\n* Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair. Crops wither, producing famines.\n* Sulfur geysers form in and around the dragon’s lair. Some of them erupt only once an hour, so they’re spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature on top of an erupting geyser takes 21 (6d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, the arguments and misunderstandings disappear immediately and the temperatures go back to normal within 1d10 days. Any geysers remain where they are."

Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.  \nDespite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.  \n**Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.  \n**Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon’s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.  \n\n## Sea Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nSea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.  \nWhatever the place, it’s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.  \nThe sky surrounding a sea dragon’s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary sea dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.\n* Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.\n* Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days."

        "desc": "_This aquamarine dragon has a shark’s head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings._  \n**Divine Dragons.** Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.  \nDespite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.  \n**Shipwreck Art.** Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon’s lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.  \n**Sunken Memorials.** A sea dragon’s lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.  \n\n## Sea Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nSea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.  \nWhatever the place, it’s dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.  \nThe sky surrounding a sea dragon’s lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action and generates one of the following effects. The dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* Four vortexes, each 5 feet in diameter and up to 30 feet tall, appear within the lair where the dragon wishes. Creatures occupying the space where a vortex appears or who enter the vortex for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or be restrained. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from a vortex by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon creates a wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area takes damage as if touching the wall and is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, on whichever side of the wall it wants. Touching the wall releases painful stings that deal 18 (4d8) poison damage, or half that with a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon bends time around its enemies. Four creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be affected by a slow spell. This effect last until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary sea dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.\n* Water temperatures drop sharply within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures not accustomed to cold suffer exposure to extreme cold while swimming in this water.\n* Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, conditions of the sea surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of 1d10 days."

They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.  \n**Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.  \n**Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.  \n\n## A Void Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nThe true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon’s lair rests in the great void of space.  \nWhen a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.  \nIf fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected).

They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.  \n**Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.  \n**Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.  \n\n## A Void Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nThe true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon’s lair rests in the great void of space.  \nWhen a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.  \nIf fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n* The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary void dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.\n* Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light in this area.\n* Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days."

        "desc": "_A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon’s body._  \n**Children of the Stars.** Void dragons drift through the empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world, wanderers between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth, including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.  \n**Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a rage and lash out.  \n**Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures. Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their latent madness like a violation of their hoard.  \n\n## A Void Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nThe true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the void dragon’s lair rests in the great void of space.  \nWhen a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks, valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course, and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their lairs.  \nIf fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift 10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count 20 on the following round.\n* The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.\n* The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place. Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions. Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked prone, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.\n  \n### Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a legendary void dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n* Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.\n* Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light in this area.\n* Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair. Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the world in this area.\n  \nIf the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days."

        "desc": "_Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat._  \nWind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.  \n_**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.  \n_**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.  \n_**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.  \nWind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic items—often quite portable.  \n\n## Wind Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nWind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can’t pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.\n* Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair’s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n* A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn."

Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.  \n_**Braggarts and Bullies.**_ Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.  \n_**Lords of the Far Horizons.**_ Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.  \n_**Perpetual Infighting.**_ These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.  \nWind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic items—often quite portable.  \n\n## Wind Dragon’s Lair\n\n  \nWind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can’t pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n* Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.\n* Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair’s wall by a blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.\n* A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling. If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius; if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius. Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of their next turn."

While most groves consist of only one type of dragonleaf tree, dragons sometimes make gifts of them to cement a pact or as a show of fealty. The dragon giving the tree relinquishes command of the plant as part of the deal. This accounts for mixed groves belonging to especially powerful dragon lords.  \n**Silent Guardians.** Dragonleaf trees use fairly simple tactics to deter potential intruders. They remain motionless or allow the breeze to jostle their leaves to appear inconspicuous. Once enough targets enter the grove, the trees fire razor sharp leaves at or breathe on their targets, adjusting their position to make better use of their weapons.  \n**Long Memories.** Dragonleaf trees live up to 1,000 years. They stand 15 feet tall and weigh 3,000 lb, but ancient specimens can reach heights of 45 feet. Growing a new dragonleaf tree requires a cutting from an existing tree at least 50 years old, which the tree’s master imbues with power, sacrificing the use of its breath weapon for a month. While this time barely registers on a dragon’s whole lifespan, it still carefully considers the creation of a new tree, for fear that others might discover its temporary weakness."

To placate the creatures, owners of smelters and smithies leave large piles of ash for the drakes to play in, with the hope they leave the shop and its workers alone. Anyone hunting ash drakes finds them very difficult to attack in their cramped lairs because the creatures blend in with the surroundings. Ash drakes often befriend kobolds, who have little trouble appeasing the beasts and appreciate the added security they bring.  \n**Hunt Strays and Pets.** Ash drakes eat rats and stray animals, although few can resist snatching an unattended, possibly beloved pet. Contrary to popular opinion, this drake doesn’t consume ash, but enjoys a pile of ash like a cat would catnip, rolling around in it and becoming wild-eyed. Anyone who disrupts such play becomes the target of the creature’s intensely hot and sooty breath weapon.  \nWhile an ash drake is three feet long with a four-foot long tail that seems to trail off into smoke, it weighs less than one might expect—approximately ten lb. Every third winter, when chimneys are active, a male drake leaves his lair to find a mate. If the new couple roosts in a city or town, the nearby streets know it, as the air becomes nearly unbreathable with soot. The resulting eggs are left in a suitable chimney, and one of the parents protects the young until they leave the nest at two years of age.  \n**Volcanic Haunts.** Ash drakes outside a city live in or near volcanic plateaus, and mutter about the lack of neighbors to bully. In the wild, an ash drake may partner with a red dragon or flame dragon, since the dragon provides its lesser cousin with plenty of ash."

Needle-thin talons spring from finned appendages, and a stinger frilled with tiny barbs curves at the end of its slender tail.  \nA coral drake measures seven feet from the tip of its snout to its barbed stinging tail.

Because they are immune to poison, coral drakes often choose lairs nestled in forests of poisonous sea urchins, stinging anemones, and toxic corals.  \nAside from humankind, the coral drake harbors a great rivalry with dragon turtles.

Goblins gleefully adopt a crimson drake as a mascot to burn things down while they get on with slaughtering people. Red dragons and flame dragons regard a crimson drake as a pet, at best, but this rarely works out. When it is inevitably insulted by its larger cousins, a malicious crimson drake may even intentionally set fires to blaze a trail for hunters to the dragon’s lair.  \n**Mistaken for Pseudodragons.** A crimson drake’s scales and features are quite similar to those of a pseudodragon, and they will imitate a pseudodragon’s hunting cry or song to trick victims into approaching. Once their prey gets close enough, they immolate it.  \nAs with pseudodragons, they resemble a red dragon in all but size and the presence of the drake’s scorpion-like stinger. On average, a crimson drake weighs 12 lb, its body measures about 18 inches long, and its tail adds another 18 inches.  \n**Foul Familiars.** A crimson drake occasionally chooses to serve an evil spellcaster as a familiar; they are too mischievous to be loyal or trustworthy, but ferocious in defense of their master."

Whereas most drakes attach themselves to humanoids, these creatures feel much more at home with aberrations and undead. They avoid sunlight and are strictly nocturnal when on the surface.  \n**Few in Number.** A deep drake mates for life with another deep drake when two of these rare creatures meet. A hermaphroditic creature, the drake assumes a gender until it finds a mate, at which time it may change. Once every 10-20 years, the drakes reproduce, resulting in three or four three‑foot long, rubbery eggs. Occasionally, subterranean undead or aberrations take these eggs to their cities to train the young drakes. A “household drake” is a great status symbol in some deep places, and surface necromancers who have heard of them are often extremely eager to acquire one.  \nDeep drakes are 12 feet long, plus a three-foot long tail, and weigh up to 1,500 pounds.

Those who survive this process gain even stranger, esoteric abilities, such as the ability to “stamp” text or images with their feet, the ability to make illustrations move as if alive, or even the ability to erase the memory of written words from a person’s mind, much as they erase text from a page.  \nIn their regular form, paper drakes reach just over four feet in length and weight around 30 lb.

Either way, the drowned maiden awakens from death seeking vengeance. Even as she dishes out retribution, a drowned maiden often anguishes over her doomed existence and tragic fate.  \n**Beckoning for Help.** The maiden lurks in the silent depths where she died—usually deserted docks, bridges, or coastal cliffs. She waits to pull the living to the same watery grave in which she is now condemned. A drowned maiden uses her disguise self ability to appear as in life. She silently beckons victims from afar, as if in danger of drowning. When within range, the maiden uses her hair to pull her victim close enough to kiss it. Victims soon weaken and drown. The victim’s final vision is the drowned maiden’s tearful lament over the loss of life.  \n**Death to Betrayers.** Desperate individuals may bargain with drowned maidens, and they will release pleading victims who promise to return to their lair with the person who caused the maiden’s death. Embracing and drowning her betrayer releases the maiden from undeath."

They surround their prey, latching on with their powerful jaws. Non-aquatic prey are dragged into the depths to drown. Similarly, eel hounds often force aquatic prey up onto dry land to die of suffocation.  \nPossessed of a low cunning, they prepare ambushes by vomiting forth their slippery spittle where land animals come to drink or along game trails. They surge out of the water to snatch prey while it is off balance.  \n**Liquid Speech.** Eel hounds understand Sylvan, and those dwelling near humans or other races pick up a few words in other tongues."

Regardless of how often they are slain, the einherjar reappear each morning in Odin’s hall, so they have no fear of death, and their courage shames others into greater bravery.  \n**Defenders of the Mortal World.** From time to time, the ravenfolk guide a troop of the einherjar against some of Loki’s minions or the servants of Boreas. These raids are often small battles, but the einherjar know they are only delaying the inevitable rise of the world serpent and its many evil spawn. This drives them to greater efforts against giants, demons, lindwurms, and other evil creatures, but the einherjar themselves are not exactly saintly. They drink, they carouse, they slap and tickle and brag and boast and fart with the loudest and most boastful of Asgardians. Unlike most extraplanar creatures, they are very human, if somewhat larger than life.  \n**Fear Dragons.** The einherjar have a notable soft spot for the ratatosk and the ravenfolk, but they are superstitiously fearful of dragons of all kinds. They sometimes hunt or ride or carouse with the fey lords and ladies.  \n**Never Speak to the Living.** In theory, the einherjar are forbidden from speaking with the living: they must pass their words through a valkyrie, a ratatosk, one of the ravenfolk, or other races allied with Asgard. In practice, this rule is often flouted, though if Loki’s servants notice it, they can dismiss any einherjar back to Valhalla for a day."

To capture their victims, eleinomae weave a net from swamp reeds and grasses, and decorate it with beautiful blossoms that release an intoxicating, bewitching aroma.  \n**Aquatic Cemeteries.** They are known to keep the most handsome captives as companions—for a time, at least, but they invariably grow weary of their company and drown them. Many eleinomae preserve the bodies of previous mates in aquatic cemeteries where the corpses float among fields of water lilies, and they spend much time singing to the dead. Such watery graveyards are often guarded by charmed allies of the eleinomae or other caretakers.  \n**Vain Singers.** While eleinomae have few weaknesses, their vanity and overconfidence can be exploited to vanquish them. They are proud of their sweet voices and clever creation of songs and harmonies."

To savants, they are the creatures that taught the shadowdancers all they know, and kept many secrets to themselves. They were once elves like all others, dwelling in mortal lands beneath the sun. An ancient catastrophe drove them to darkness, and now they are creatures of the shadow. Though they can be found on the Material Plane, they are inextricably tied to the plane of Shadows, and that is the seat of their power and culture.  \nShadow fey superficially resemble other elves, but they’re rarely mistaken for their lighted cousins. Skin tones among the shadow fey range from alabaster white to ebony black, with varying shades of gray in between, but they are otherwise lacking in color. A few have a scintillating shimmer to their skin. Many shadow fey grow horns that sweep out from their hair, varying in size from subtle nubs to obvious spikes. Others have shocking sets of teeth.  \n**Dual Natured.** The shadow fey are contradictory beings. They boast some of the best features of elves, tempered by aspects of a fouler nature. They can be deliberate and purposeful, but they’re also given to perplexing whimsy. Mortal creatures trying to fathom shadow fey motivations are in for a maddening experience; they are often illogical, capricious, and seemingly thrive on annoying others.  \n**Split Rulership.** The Summer Court and Winter Court each rule the shadow fey in the appropriate season. The turning of these seasons follows no clear calendar or schedule, though it is skewed toward summer.  \nOther fey call them the Scáthsidhe (pronounced scAH-shee), or shadow faeries, and they are usually counted among the unseelie, though they would dispute that characterization. They simply call themselves part of the sidhe, and consider themselves an extension of the Seelie Court.  \n**The Reach of Darkness.** Their bond with darkness allows the shadow fey to slip through distant spaces, traversing darkness itself from one place to another. Not only can every shadow fey slip from a shadow or patch of darkness to instantly appear elsewhere, they also control the mysterious and powerful shadow roads. Shadow roads are magical pathways that connect points on the Material Plane by dipping through the plane of shadow, allowing rapid and completely secret travel for the fey—and more importantly, for their weapons of war, their trade goods, and their allies.  \nThe shadow fey all have an instinctive understanding of how a shadow road functions, and they are adept at both operating the entrance portals and navigating any hazards on the road. This bond with darkness has a price, of course, and the shadow fey shun the sun’s light."

These are the emerald eyes._  \n**Servants of Logic.** A mystic or psion will debate logic with a speaking crystal based on his rational mind, or discuss morality with a speaking crystal based on his conscience. Chaotic psions create speaking crystals based on their primal urges, and such crystals sometimes abandon or even kill their creators. Once free, they revel in the world’s pleasures.  \n**Trapped Manipulators.** Most speaking crystals are pink or purple when created, but those that betray their creators turn a dark shade of green. These floating oval-shaped crystals are physically weak, but they retain considerable magical powers to manipulate those around them. This becomes critically important when the emerald eye discovers that killing its creator frees it from the creator’s control but doesn’t free it from the need to remain within 25 feet of some creature it is bound to. This is often the dead body of its creator if no other creature is available.  \n**Shifting Goals.** An emerald eye’s motivations change over time. One may be purposeful, using its powers to drive its bound creature toward some specific goal. Another might feign cooperativeness, offering to share its defensive abilities in exchange for the creature’s mobility. Still another might be a manipulative trickster, pretending to be an ioun stone, floating in circles around an ally’s or victim’s head while sparkling brightly to inspire jealousy and theft among its viewers.  \nSmaller than a clenched fist, an emerald eye weighs at most half a pound.  \n**Constructed Nature.** An emerald eye doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

To their misfortune, returning to their own time proved much more difficult than leaving it, so the eonic drifters found themselves adrift in the river of time. As the decades passed, their chance of returning home withered, along with the flesh of their bodies. They have been become mummified by the passing ages.  \n**Crystal Belts.** A drifter carries an odd assembly of gear gathered in countless centuries, proof of its tragic journey. The more eclectic the collection, the more jumps it has performed on its odyssey.  \nBelts of crystals around its body store the energy that fuels a drifter’s travels. After each large jump through time, the reservoirs are exhausted and can be used only for very short jumps.  \n**Jittery and Paranoid.** Visiting countless eras in which mankind has all but forgotten this once-great civilization has robbed most eonic drifters of their sanity. Their greatest fear is being robbed of their crystal belts. They plead or fight for them as if their lives depended on them—which, in a sense, they do. Adventurers who convince a drifter of their good intentions may be asked for aid. In exchange, a drifter can offer long-lost artifacts gathered from many forays through time.  \nDrifters can appear at any time or place, but they often frequent the sites of their people’s past (or future) cities. There they are comforted by knowing that they’re at least in the right place, if not the right time."

Those bound to these pacts become warlocks, but the will and force of their patron is borne by more than just those who strike bargains for sorcerous power. A fext is a former warlock who has become wholly dedicated to their patron—mind, body, and soul—and functions as enforcer, bodyguard, and assassin. They are powerful undead slaves to the will of their otherworldly patron.  \n**Linked to a Master.** Each fext is a unique servant of their patron and exhibits the physical traits of its master. The eyes of every fext are tied directly to their patron’s mind, who can see what the fext sees at any time. The fext also possesses a telepathic link to its patron.  \nThe process a warlock undergoes to become a fext is horrendous. The warlock is emptied of whatever morality and humanity he or she had as wine from a jug, and the patron imbues the empty vessel with its corruption and unearthly will. Whatever life the fext led before is completely gone. They exist only to serve.  \n**Outdoing Rivals.** Scholars have debated about how many fext a patron can command. The more powerful and well-established have at least 100, while others have only a handful. Where there is more than one fext, however, they maneuverings amongst themselves to curry favor with their powerful lord. Each fext is bound to obey commands, but they attempt to carry them out to the detriment of their competitors. Scheming is common and rampant among them and they try to work without the aid of other fext as much as possible.  \n**Undead Nature.** A fext doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Some druidic legends claim the fraughashar were born out of a winter so cold and cruel that the spirits of the river itself froze. Bardic tales claim that the fraughashar are a tribe of corrupted goblins, and that they were permanently disfigured during a botched attempt at summoning an ice devil.

Gbahalis live solitary lives except during the fall, when males seek out females in their territory. Females lay eggs in the spring and guard the nest until the eggs hatch, but the young gbahali are abandoned to their own devices. Killing an adult gbahali is a sign of bravery and skill for plains hunters.  \n_**Sentries and Stragglers.**_ In combat, a gbahali relies on its chameleon power to ambush prey. It may wait quietly for hours, but its speed and stealth mean it strikes quickly, especially against weak or solitary prey. Its onslaught is strong enough to scatter a herd and leave behind the slowest for the gbahali to bring down."

On a failed save the victim takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction can't be removed until the victim recovers from darakhul fever, and even then only by greater restoration or similar magic. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days. Greater restoration cures the disease; lesser restoration allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll 1d20, add the character's current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in. Adjustment Table Roll Result:\n\n1-9 None; victim is simply dead\n\n10-16 Ghoul\n\n17-20 Ghast\n\n21+ Darakhul",

Their rich brown skin is rough-textured, and they dress in light robes matching the color of the sand, accented (when they aren’t trying to blend in) with brightly colored head cloths and sashes. Beneath their robes, the desert giants paint or tattoo their skin with intricate designs in a riot of colors that outsiders rarely see.  \n**Wandering Legacy.** Desert giants subsist in the scorching wastes by moving from oasis to oasis. They follow herds of desert animals that they cultivate for milk, meat, and hides, and they shun most contact with settled people. They can survive the blazing heat of the high summer, because desert giants know secret ways with relatively plentiful water and the location of cool, shaded caverns.  \nWhile in ages past the desert giants lived in stationary settlements and cities, the fall of their ancient empire drove them into the dunes. The truth behind their nomadic lifestyle is a sore spot; should any outsider learn the truth, the desert giants stop at nothing to permanently silence the inquisitive soul.  \n**Keepers of the Past.** Over time, wandering desert giants amass vast knowledge of ruins and relics scattered across and beneath their homeland. On rare occasions that the tribes require something of outsiders, this information is their most valuable commodity. Relics of the past, or simply the location of unplundered ruins, can purchase great advantage for the tribe.  \nThe designs the giants painstakingly inscribe on their bodies tell a tale that, if woven together correctly, reveals an entire tribe’s collected discoveries. For this reason, the desert giants hold the bodies of their dead in sacred esteem. They go to extraordinary lengths to recover their dead, so they can divide the knowledge held on the deceased’s skin among other tribe members. In the cases of desert giant elders, this hidden writing may be equivalent to spell scrolls."

Because a flab giant can eat practically anything, it doesn’t have to roam far to find enough food to sustain its bulk, so it is rarely found far from its crude lair.  \n**Knotted Skins.** Flab giants wear only scraps of clothing made of loosely knotted skins, leaving most of their stretch-marked and discolored skin exposed.

        "desc": "_So called by some watermen because of its method of hunting, the glass gator is a nearly-transparent ambush hunter. It usually strikes from a bed of water, either stagnant or flowing. The transparency of the creature, combined with its jet of silt and poisonous sting, make it an effective hunter._  \n**Strange Anatomy.** The body of a glass gator is most similar to a centipede, but with four oversized forelimbs and a more distinct head. The forelimbs are used to attack, but they tire easily, forcing the glass gator to use its powerful lunge attack sparingly.  \nOnce the glass gator gets hold of prey, it wraps its body around the victim and squeezes, like a constrictor snake. Unlike a serpent, however, which uses powerful muscles to crush and suffocate its prey, the glass gator is only trying to bring its underbelly into contact with the prey. The glass gator’s belly is lined with hundreds of stingers that deliver a virulent nerve toxin.  \n**Transparency.** The glass gator’s transparency isn’t total. Its digestive tract usually is visible, especially for a few hours after it eats. The creature sometimes uses this limited visibility as bait, making itself appear as a wriggling snake or eel. It is most vulnerable just after eating, when it’s lethargic; if encountered in its lair shortly after a meal, the DM may give the glass gator disadvantage on initiative.  \n**Larval Form.** Subterranean variants—including some with bioluminescence—have been reported in caverns. It’s been postulated that the glass gator may be the larval form of a larger creature, but what that larger creature might be is unknown."

But once it starts hopping in pursuit of a target, it reveals its animated nature and its only motivation: destruction of living things.  \n**Endless Snapping.** Gnarljaks are mindless. They do not grow tired. They exist only to pull creatures to the ground and chew through them, then turn around and chew through them again.  \n**Defensive Traps.** Some try to use gnarljaks to guard treasures or booby-trap approaches to important locations, but their indiscriminate biting makes quite dangerous to their owners as well. Certain monsters such as redcaps and shadow fey use gnarljak’s with some regularity, and gnomes are very fond of making them part of a standard tunnel defense."

A hoard golem can crash down with the weight of a fortune, flattening everything in its path._  \n**Dragon Fears Made Real.** The hoard golems were born from the paranoia of dragons. Despite their great physical and intellectual power, dragons are always suspicious of any creature willing to work for them. The first hoard golem was created when a dragon realized that there could be no guardian more trustworthy with its hoard than the hoard itself. Since then, the secret of hoard golem construction has emerged, and rich nobles have followed suit, enchanting their wealth to defend itself from thieves.  \n**Patient Homebodies.** As constructs, hoard golems are mindless, lying in wait for anyone other than their creator to come within striking distance. In the case of evil dragons, this may include the wyrmlings of dragon parents looking to establish dominance in the family. Hoard golems fight to the death, but they rarely leave the rooms they inhabit for fear that clever treasure hunters might trick the hoard into walking itself right out of the owner’s den.  \n**Silent and Wealthy.** Hoard golems cannot speak. A hoard golem is 25 feet tall and weighs 20,000 lb. A hoard golem’s body is composed of items—copper, silver, gold, works of art, armor, weapons, and magical items—worth at least 5,000 gp.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Owl harpies never grow hair, only feathers, which often wreathe their faces and crown their heads like a headdress. Their taloned feet are strong and razor sharp. They are much stronger fliers than lesser harpies; they swoop and hover in mid-air with ease to tear their prey apart. They are found in temperate climates as well as in deserts and jungles.  \n**Noctural Magic.** Owl harpies practice a rare, potent magic associated with darkness and the night. They can counter most light sources easily. So refined is their hearing that neither darkness nor invisibility detracts from their ability to hunt their quarry. Their acute hearing also means that thunder attacks distress them.  \nOwl harpies are natural (if irredeemably evil) bards thanks to their sharp wits. Less common but not unheard of are owl harpy oracles, scholars, and collectors. These savants are known to exchange their knowledge and insights for companionship or for unusual gifts and treasures."

They are more humble and less prone to taking umbrage, and indeed, a great many haugbui have long since forgotten their own names. They are not quick to spill blood when irritated, and thus are viewed with greater tolerance by the living.  \n**Scrye and Watch.** They prefer to watch over their people from within their mound, and only come forth over the most grievous insults or injuries. They can do a great deal from within their mounds thanks to their scrying ability.  \n**Undead Nature.** A haugbui doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Speaking of this form is difficult, but poets and bards trying to describe it have said it resembles an apocalyptic horror built of chained souls and the slow death of children carried along in a glacial river, rushing to an inevitable doom.  \n**Sword and Cloak.** The black sword and star-scattered cloak of a herald of darkness are part of its magical substance and cannot be parted from it. Some believe the cloak and blade are true visions of its body; the smiling face and pleasing form are entirely illusory.  \n**Corruptors of the Fey.** The heralds of darkness are companions and sometimes masters to the shadow fey. They seek to draw many others into their orbit with wild promises of great power, debauchery, and other delights. They are rivals to the heralds of blood and bitter foes to all angels of light."

If the isonade dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.",

        "desc": "_The isonade’s gargantuan thrashing tail is lined with cruelly hooked barbs, and it delights in destruction. When it approaches a coastal village, its tail shoots high into the air from beneath the waves, and it smashes all ships, docks, and nets in its path._  \n**Coastal Destroyer.** The isonade is a beast of destruction, sweeping away entire islands and villages. It wrecks seaside communities with battering winds and carves coastlines with its powerful magic. Though not very intelligent, it singles out a community and tries to lure residents into the waves with its animal messenger ability, sending gulls bearing confused riddles, grand promises, and eerie noises to the townsfolk.  \n**Ocean Sacrifices.** When coastal villagers suffered from a hurricane or tsunami, they fell back on folklore and blamed the stirrings of the dreaded isonade. To some, appeasing a leviathan such as this makes sense. Some say that a degenerate group seeks to draw the beast forth by sailing from sight of land and dumping a long chain of bound and screaming sacrifices into the lightless depths of the sea.  \n**Enormous Age and Size.** The isonade is more than 45 feet long. The beast’s age is unknown, and many coastal bards tell some version of the legend—some believe it is the last of its kind, others believe that a small group of isonade remains."

Also called the javelin snake, a jaculus loves shiny or reflective items, and it is clever enough to identify items of real value. It will fight and kill to take items it desires, which it stashes inside hollow trees far from any forest trail.  \n**Leapers.** Jaculi are far better jumpers than flyers. They can jump 18 feet horizontally or 12 feet vertically after taking a single 2-foot step. They even climb faster than they fly, so they use their wings to flap clumsily back into the trees only when necessary.  \n**Teamwork Thievery.** Jaculi are among the least intelligent of the dragons—but they’re still smarter than most humans, and they’re known to pursue cunning and complicated plots to build their hoards. Many traditional tales tell of jaculi in the southern forests working as teams to separate merchants and other travelers from their wealth, figuring out ways to abscond with gems and jewelry before the owners even know they’ve been robbed. Some jaculi may feign docility or even pretend to be friendly and helpful, but wise travelers know that the creatures drop such ruses as soon as they can steal what they’re really after."

All kalkes act with the arrogance of magi while having the social characteristics of baboons. Being of fiendish blood, kalkes do not age and require neither food nor drink. Though lacking any formal spellcasting ability, all kalkes can produce magical effects through the dramatic mumming of largely spontaneous and unstudied rituals.  \n**Hoard Magical Paraphernalia.** The drive to produce ever more fanciful rituals gives a kalke the compulsion to accumulate spell components, magical foci, and other occult paraphernalia. Although these objects serve no purpose, the kalkes seek out spellcasters in their vicinity and steal any paraphernalia they can find. Because they have no ability to distinguish what’s magically useful from what isn’t, they grab any jewelry, pouches, sticks, or ornate objects they uncover. Sometimes children, animals, or other small humanoids are taken to be used as sacrifices, if they can be easily carried away.  \n**Perform Rituals.** Troops of kalkes inhabit trees, caverns, and ruins around sites of significant magical activity. Twice a month, or more during major astrological and seasonal events, the kalkes gather to perform—by way of dance, chant, and sacrifice—an imagined rite of great magic. The effort has an equal chance of achieving nothing whatsoever, causing dangerous but short-lived misfortunes (snakes raining on the countryside, creatures summoned from the lower planes), or triggering calamities (great fires or floods).  \nAn additional side effect of these rituals is that the troop may gain or lose members magically. If the troop numbers less than 13, a new kalke appears as if from nowhere; if it contains 13 or more members, then 3d4 of them find themselves mysteriously gated to the nearest location of magical activity—often hundreds of miles away. Those teleported arrive in a state of hysteria, with individuals extinguishing flames, grabbing frippery, and running in all directions. Because kalkes have no control over their displacement, it’s not surprising to find them in abandoned dungeons or keeps, clutching the property of some long-lost wizard.  \n**Hagglers.** The kalkes will return the goods they've taken, in exchange for a ransom or fee. These exchanges need to have the outward appearance of being impressively in the kalke’s favor. A particularly generous (or devious) spellcaster may be able to reach an accommodation with a persistent local troop of kalkes."

Inside the hidey-hole, a kikimora can see what is going on outside the space through a special sensor. This sensor functions like a window, and it can be blocked by mundane objects placed in front of the sigil. If she leaves an item in her space, it remains there even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. If someone else removes the sigil, all contents are emptied into the Ethereal Plane (including any beings within her hidey-hole at the time).

They then convince the house’s residents to leave gifts as enticement for making repairs in the night.  \n**Brownie Hunters.** Kikimoras hate brownies. While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras bring pain and frustration on their housemates instead of remaining hidden and helping chores along. Some brownies seek out kikimora‑infested homes with the intention of evicting them.  \nIf homeowners refuse to appease the kikimora (or cannot rid themselves of her devious presence), the kikimora sends a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats. Many times inhabitants in a home plagued by a kikimora believe it is haunted.  \n**Fast Talkers.** While they try to avoid notice and aren’t great talespinners, kikimoras are convincing and use this influence to gain an upper hand—or to evade capture or avoid violence."

Their scaly skin and keen night vision as well as their dextrous claws and sensitive snouts make them quick to sense danger, and their clawed feet move them out of danger with cowardly speed. They are small but fierce when fighting on their own terms, and their weight of numbers helps them survive in places where larger but less numerous races can’t sustain a settlement. Kobolds are great miners, good gearsmiths, and modest alchemists, and they have a curiosity about the world that frequently gets them into trouble.  \n_**Underworld Merchants.**_ Kobolds are merchants to both the surface world and the world beneath it, with their greatest cities hidden deep below the earth. Their enemies are the diabolical gnomes, the dwarves, and any other mining races that seek dominance of dark, rich territories.  \nKobolds are closely allied with and related to dragonborn, drakes, and dragons. The kobold kings (and there are oh‑so‑many kobold kings, since no kobold ruler is satisfied with being merely a chieftain) admire dragons as the greatest sources of wisdom, power, and proper behavior.  \n_This small, draconic humanoid struts as though it were ten feet tall. It wears the gilded skull of a small dragon as a helmet, and its beady eyes gleam out through the skull’s sockets. It hefts its spear and shield and lets out a blood-curdling shriek, signaling the attack._  \nWhile most kobolds are scuttling scavengers or pathetic sycophants, a few carry a spark of draconic nobility that can’t be ignored. These few forge their tribes into forces to be reckoned with, rising to the rank of chieftain. A kobold chieftain stands proud, clad in war gear of fine quality and good repair. Their weapons are tended by the tribe’s trapsmiths, particularly evident in their springspike shields.  \n_**Living Legend.**_ A kobold chieftain is more than a leader, it is a symbol of the tribe’s greatness. The strongest, most cunning, most ruthless of a kobold tribe embodies their connection to the revered dragons. When a chieftain sounds the call to battle, the kobolds meld into a fearless, deadly force."

More gentle fey rightfully find the creatures to be a menace. A kot bayun measures six feet long and weighs over 200 lb. They are long-lived, and some stories record the same kot bayun in a region for over 400 years.  \n**Sing to Sleep.** In addition to their stealthy natures and physical prowess, kot bayun have the ability to put prey to sleep with song. They carefully choose victims and stalk them for a time, learning their strengths and weaknesses before making their attack. They lay in wait until their prey is vulnerable and then begin their slumbering song. Those resisting the call to slumber are always the kot bayun’s first victims as they launch from cover and attempt to disembowel their prey. In forests with a thick canopy, a kot bayun stealthily creeps among tree limbs, tracking the movement of its prey below.  \n**Healing Poetry.** If discovered by intelligent prey, a kot bayun opens with a parley instead of claws. In rare cases, a kot bayun finds something in its prey it likes and cold predation turns to a lukewarm association.  \nBefriending a kot bayun has benefits as the creature’s poems, tales, and sagas have the magical ability to heal negative conditions. A kot bayun tells its stories in the form of strange epics and poetry, ranging from simple rhyming folk poems to complex sonnets. This ability is not widely known (a secret the creatures intend to keep), but, as folktales spread, more and more adventurers and sages seek out these elusive beasts."

Worse, they have a malicious and bloodthirsty intellect. A krake spawn is considerably smarter than most humans, who mistake them for dumb beasts—an error that can often prove fatal.  \n**Iceberg Fortresses.** Krake spawn live in remote, icy regions, where they fashion elaborate iceberg fortresses. When they venture into warmer climes in search of magic or slaves, they can preserve their icebergs with ice storms. These fortresses are stocked with frozen creatures (an emergency food supply), the krake spawn’s treasure and library, slaves or prisoners of many races, and a hellish nest filled with the krake spawn’s offspring.  \nA krake spawn measures 40 feet in length and weighs 2,000 lb."

A lantern dragonette’s unusual diet leads it to lair in libraries, abbeys, and other places of study. Even though the dragonettes eat candles essential for study during dark hours, they still provide light and protect their adopted homes. Residents and caretakers consider them good luck and enjoy conversing with them.  \n**Telepathic Chatterbox.** This gregarious drake prefers to speak with its companions but uses telepathy if necessary, and the creature hisses when surprised or displeased. It loves nothing more than discussing magic and history with an intelligent and informed individual.  \n**Adventurous Companions.** Occasionally, a dragonette wishing to learn more about the world finds a spellcaster or adventuring party to travel with, purely for the sake of learning or to acquire new sources of knowledge. Most parties enjoy the traveling light source and the abilities these companions bring to bear. A lantern dragonette avoids combat and uses its abilities only to escape or to defend its lair, family, and friends.  \nA dragonette lives up to 30 years. A mated pair produces one clutch of two to five eggs every five years, and one parent raises the young dragonettes until they mature after a year and leave to search for their own lairs. A cloister of lantern dragonettes taxes their lair’s resources, so the other parent often ventures out to retrieve more candles."

Leshy have little patience for interlopers and often kill, abduct, or frighten off trailblazers and guides. With their plant growth ability, they sabotage cultivated land, wipe out trails, and create weed walls and thickets to keep civilization at bay. Using speak with plants, they transplant dangerous plant creatures to discourage new settlements. Some have wrangled rabid animals to the same purpose.  \n**Ax Thieves.** Leshy prefer trickery to combat, particularly enjoying leading interlopers astray through use of their mimicry. If challenged, they use their ability to change size to scare intruders away, but they never hesitate to fight to the death in service to the forest if necessary. Leshy hate metal, especially axes, and they go out of their way to steal metal items and lead those who use them astray.  \n**Accept Bribes.** With careful courting and appropriate gifts, it is possible to gain a leshy’s capricious assistance. This can be risky, because leshy love mischief. Still, at times a leshy’s help is essential to a group traversing ancient woodlands."

Once a likho has leapt onto a creature, it shreds flesh using the claws on both its hands and feet.  \n**Jeers and Insults.** A likho uses its message spells to taunt and jeer its target from a distance during the hunt. In addition, to flinging curses and ill luck, likho frustrate and infuriate their enemies because they are difficult to hit. A likho enjoys stalking intelligent humanoids and tormenting them from hiding until discovered or when it grows tired of the hunt.  \n**Organ Eaters.** Likho thrive when they drain away luck and aptitude. Once the likho immobilizes a creature, it gnaws at the creature’s abdomen with its jagged teeth, devouring the organs of its still-living prey. A likho consumes only a humanoid’s organs and leaves the rest of the carcass behind."

If their controller demands it, all living wicks can release the magic contained within their form all at once, engulfing themselves and anyone nearby in flames. This can make storing them a gamble, but many see it as an asset, especially those seeking to destroy evidence or anonymously attack their enemies.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A living wick doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

While the siren’s powers affect women as readily as men, the lorelei lacks the urge to destroy them. Women traveling alone or in all-female groups may pass through a lorelei’s territory safely, and might even make peaceful contact. However, women who protect male companions are viewed as traitors, inspiring wrath."

Hating and fearing all strangers, they live in open plains and scrubland._  \n**Nomadic Families.** Loxodas live in small herds of 2-3 extended families. Several of these communities will usually cluster together, allowing members to move between groups as they get older. They have no permanent settlements, and instead loxoda families travel to new areas when they deplete the available food. Voracious eaters, a family of loxodas will quickly strip trees bare of leaves, or hunt and cook an entire elephant. They devour both meat and vegetation.  \n**Often Underestimated.** Many people assume that loxodas are as dull witted as the ogres they resemble. This is often a fatal mistake, as the elephant centaurs are quite intelligent. Their simple equipment and straightforward living comes not from a lack of skill or knowledge, but their own isolationism and xenophobia. Their immense size and quadruped body makes it difficult for them to mine metal ore, and they violently reject communications and trade with other people. The little metal they can gather is either taken from the bodies of their prey or stolen in raids on dwarven, human, or gnoll settlements.  \n**Vestigial Tusks.** All loxodas have curved tusks. While they are too small for use in even ritual combat, they are often decorated with intricate carvings, inlays or dyed in a pattern developed by their family. Each individual also adapts the patterns with their own individual marks, often inspired by important events in their lives. Some loxodas put golden rings or jewelled bracelets stolen from humanoids onto their tusks as trophies—a loxoda matriarch may have long dangling chains of such ornaments, indicating her high status and long life. They stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly 20,000 pounds."

Skraeling use the mahoru’s fangs to make arrowheads or tooth-studded clubs, and the mahoru is a totem beast for many northern tribes.  \n**Iceberg Hunters.** Relatives of the bunyip, mahoru prowl northern coasts and estuaries, hunting among the fragmenting pack ice each summer. They lurk beneath the surface, catching swimmers chunks or lurching up onto the ice to break or tilt it and send prey tumbling into the water. When necessary, they stalk beaches and riverbanks in search of carrion or unwary victims.  \n**Work in Pairs and Packs.** Mahoru work together in mated pairs to corral everything from fish and seals to larger prey like kayaking humans and even polar bears. They gnaw at ice bridges and the frozen surface of lakes and rivers to create fragile patches that plunge unwary victims into their waiting jaws."

Shortly thereafter, the mask wights were conceived.  \n**Rites of Annihilation.** To create these undead, the lord of shadows stole the bodies of death knights from beneath the necropolis of an arch-lich. Then, the goddess of the underworld sacrificed a million condemned souls and drained their essence into ivory masks—one for each fiend the couple sought to annihilate. Finally, the masks were hammered onto the knights with cold iron nails, and their armored husks were left at the bottom of the memory-draining River Styx for 600 years.  \nWhen they rose, the mask wights marched out into the planes to bury knowledge, conjure secrets, and erase their quarry from memory and history.  \n**Ready for Betrayal.** Kept secret from one another, though, the two each created an additional mask wight, a safeguard for in case betrayal should cross their lover’s mind.  \n**Undead Nature.** A mask wight doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Though millitaurs are territorial, they sometimes chase away threats rather than kill intruders. However, they also are good hunters and supplement their diet with squirrel, monkey, and even gnome or goblin.  \n**Poisonous Drool.** As formidable as they appear, millitaurs are the preferred prey of some dragons and jungle giants, and tosculi often hunt them for use as slaves and pack animals. In defense, they’ve developed a mild poison. Millitaur handaxes often drip with this substance, smeared onto them from the beast’s mandibles. They use their axes for breaking up mulch for easier digestion, as well as using them for hunting and self-defense.  \n**Clicking Speech.** Millitaurs communicate via body language, antennae movements, scent, and clicking sounds. Although they have no voice boxes, millitaurs can make sounds by artfully clicking and grinding their mandibles, and they can mimic the sounds of Common in a peculiar popping tone. They can be good sources for local information so long as they are treated with respect and their territory is not encroached."

When inhaled, mindrot spores enter the brain through the bloodstream. As the fungus grows, it dissolves the host’s body and slowly replaces the creature’s flesh with its own.  \nThe fungus’s first target is the motor function of the brain. It takes control of the creature’s movement while the victim is still alive and fully conscious—but no longer controls his or her own body! Indeed, sensory awareness may be the last function that the fungus attacks. Eventually, even the victim’s skin and muscle are replaced with fungal fibers. At that point, the affected creature no longer looks like its former self. Such a newly-born mindrot thrall conceals its alarming appearance under heavy robes or cloaks so it can travel without causing alarm.  \n**Spore Blisters.** A thrall’s skin is taut and waxy. Blisters form just beneath the surface, and when they grow as large as a child’s fist they burst, releasing a spray of spores. It seeks to infect as many new victims as possible during the few weeks that it survives in humanoid form. At the end of that time, the thrall shrivels to a dried, vaguely humanoid husk. Even a dead mindrot thrall, however, is still dangerous because its half-formed spore blisters can remain infectious for months. Disturbing the husk can burst these blisters and trigger a Mindrot Spores attack.  \n**Dimensional Horrors.** Wizards hypothesize the fungus was brought to the mortal world by a shambling horror crossing through a dimensional portal. The remoteness of that wasteland is likely whythe mindrot fungus hasn’t destroyed whole cities, though someday it may find a more fertile breeding ground."

Every fitting is perfect; every surface is masterfully burnished and etched with detail almost invisible to the naked eye or decorated with macabre inlays and precious chasing. The skull in the helmet is mere decoration, meant to frighten the weak of heart and mislead opponents into thinking the champion is some form of undead rather than a pure construct.  \n**Keeping Out the Rabble.** As its name implies, the monolith champion serves as a guardian, warrior, or sentry. In those roles, it never tires, never becomes distracted or bored, never questions its loyalty, and never swerves from its duty. It delights in throwing non-fey visitors out of fey settlements and buildings.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A monolith champion doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Instead, it controls a few humanoids shuffling about aimlessly, their skin glistening with moisture, occasionally forming loose groups near the snare. These puppets pay little attention to their surroundings._  \n**Starfish Puppet Masters.** Snares bury themselves under loose soil to attack creatures walking above them. They attack by extruding filaments that inject acid into victims; this liquefies organs and muscle while leaving the skeleton, tendons, and skin intact. With the body thus hollowed out and refilled with acid and filaments, the mordant snare can control it from below like a puppet, creating a group of awkward, disoriented people. New victims fall prey to mordant snares when they approach to investigate.  \n**Brains Preferred.** The mordant snare prefers intelligent food. With its tremorsense, it can easily distinguish between prey; it prefers Small and Medium bipeds. A mordant snare hunts an area until it is empty, so a village can suffer tremendous losses or even be wiped out before discovering what’s happening. However, a mordant snare is intelligent enough to know that escaped victims may come back with friends, shovels, and weapons, ready for battle. When this occurs, the snare abandons its puppets, burrows deeper underground, and seeks a new home.  \n**Cooperative Killers.** Mordant snares are few in number and cannot reproduce. Since the secret of their creation was lost long ago, eventually they will disappear forever—until then, they cooperate well with each other, using puppets to lure victims to one another. A team is much more dangerous than a lone snare, and when three or more link up, they are especially deadly."

In their natural forms, the morphoi are androgynous beings between 5 and 6 feet tall. Their elliptical heads have eyes on both front and back. When harmed, they bleed a dark red sap.  \nAs plants, the morphoi don’t need to eat. Instead, they gather nutrients from the sun and air. When posing as humanoids, they consume small amounts of food to aid their disguise, but since they have no internal digestive system, the food is just stored inside their bodies until they can spit it out.  \n**Ship Travel.** Morphoi live in island communities and in nearby waters. Many travel by ship—usually by posing as beautiful women, handsome men, or stranded travelers. They harbor a powerful animosity toward intelligent animal life, and their disguised agents are behind many otherwise inexplicable acts of sabotage and murder. Unlike doppelgangers, morphoi can’t mimic specific individuals or read thoughts. Instead, they create intriguing backgrounds to go along with their disguises.  \n**Four Eyes Always.** No matter what form they shift into, morphoi always have four eyes, never two. They can relocate their eyes to anywhere on their bodies, however, and they try to keep the second pair of eyes on the back of the head or neck (concealed by long hair or a tall collar), or the backs of the hands (under gloves but useful to peer around corners).  \nAbout one in 30 morphoi are chieftains, and they have rangers, shamans, and warlocks among them. Those chosen as infiltrators are often rogues or bards. Stories tell of shapeshifted morphoi falling in love with humans, but it is impossible for the two species to interbreed."

Despite their ominous name, deathcap myconids are chiefly farmers. They cultivate dozens of species of mushrooms anywhere they have water, dung, and a bit of earth or slime in the underworld deeps. For this reason, other races rarely attack them. The ghouls do not eat them, and they cannot be made into darakhul.  \n**Toxic Spores.** Although deathcaps are mostly peaceful, their spores are toxic and sleep-inducing. They make excellent allies in combat because their abilities tend to punish attackers, but they aren’t especially lethal on their own. They use their poison and slumber spores to full effect against living creatures; they typically flee from constructs and undead. They count on their allies (carrion beetles, darakhul, purple worms, dark creepers, or even various devils) to fend off the most powerful foes.  \n**Clones.** Deathcap myconids live in communal groups of related clones. They reproduce asexually, and an elder and its offspring can be nearly identical in all but age. These clone groups are called deathcap rings.  \nMyconids build no huts or towns, but their groups are defined by their crops and general appearance. Indeed, many sages claim that the deathcaps are merely the fruiting, mobile bodies of the forests they tend, and that this is why they fight so ferociously to defend their forests of giant fungi."

They shadow a target until after dark, then jump onto the target’s back and demand to be carried to their chosen burial ground. They cling tightly to a victim with arms and legs locked around the victim’s shoulders and midsection, begging, threatening, and biting until the victim gives in to their demands. Mylings will bite victims to death if they are unable or unwilling to carry them, or if a victim moves too slowly.  \n**Ungrateful Rest.** While all mylings seek a creature to carry them to their final resting place, even when a chosen “mount” is willing to carry the myling, the creature’s body grows immensely heavier as it nears its burial place. Once there, it sinks into the earth, taking its bearers with it. Being buried alive is their reward for helping the myling.  \n**Urchin Rhymes and Songs.** Some mylings maintain traces of the personalities they had while alive— charming, sullen, or sadistic—and they can speak touchingly and piteously. Dressed in ragged clothing, their skin blue with cold, they sometimes reach victims who believe they are helping an injured child or young adult. They hide their faces and sing innocent rhymes when they aren’t screeching in fury, for they know that their dead eyes and cold blue skin cause fright and alarm.  \n**Undead Nature.** A myling doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Over time, strange practices warped them into their current state, and they are clearly no longer purely human. Their limbs grow too long in proportion to their bodies, giving them a stooped, odd posture. Their features are angular, and a ramag’s hair is impossibly thick; each strand is the width of a human finger. They wear their strange hair tied back in decorative clasps.  \n**Portal Network.** The ramag used their innate magical gifts to maintain powerful magical conduits, ley lines that crisscrossed the titan’s empire. This mastery of arcane might allowed instantaneous travel to the farthest-flung outpost. The ramag still maintain a network of magical monoliths that connect the scattered districts of their home, but this network is frayed and fading.  \n**Studious and Powerful.** Although physically weak, the ramag are sharp-witted, studious, and naturally infused with magic. Lifetimes of exposure to the warping effect of their runaway magical energy have given the ramag innate control over magic, as well as sharp resistance to it. They are acutely aware of their responsibility for keeping magic in check, and fully know the danger of uncontrolled magical energies. Even the the lowliest ramag has a sharp intellect and a natural understanding of magic. Many ramag take up the study of wizardry. Few become wandering adventurers, but well-equipped expeditions sometimes leave their homeland to inspect the surrounding countryside."

Their strong family ties make it easy for them to found or join criminal societies--though others serve as expert scouts and saboteurs, able to infiltrate army camps, city sewers, and even castle dungeons with equal ease. Ratfolk leaders are often spellcasters and rogues.  \n**Adaptable.** Ratfolk swim well and can survive on little. Some groups are endemic to tropical and subtropical islands. Others inhabit forests, sewers, labyrinths, and ancient, ruined cities.  \n**Fast Fighters.** Ratfolk prefer light weapons and armor, fighting with speed and using numbers to bring a foe down. They have been known to ally themselves with goblins, darakhul, and kobolds on occasion, but more often prefer to serve a “Rat King” who may or may not be a rat of any kind. Such rat rulers might include a wererat, a rat king, an ogre, a minor demon or intelligent undead."

Most are pitch black, although a smattering have white feathers and red flecks._  \nThe ravenfolk are an avian race of scoundrels, schemers, and sneaks—and they are much more than that. Long ago when Odin brokered the truce that brought peace among the gods, the wily deity magically created the ravenfolk from feathers plucked from his ravens Huginn (Thought) and Muninn (Memory.) He placed this new race into the world alongside elves, dwarves, humans, and others to be his spies.  \n**Odin’s Children.** To this day, the ravenfolk are Odin’s agents and embody his thought and memory. They are thieves of objects, yes, but primarily, they are thieves of secrets. Their black feathers and long beaks are spotted on the road from place to place, trading information or helping to hatch plots. They are widely viewed as spies, informers, thieves, and troublemakers, but when the ravenfolk swear an oath, they abide by it.  \nOdin grants the best of his ravenfolk magical runespears and runestaves, two-handed heavy weapons enchanted to serve his messengers. These function as long spears or quarterstaves in the hands of other races. The ravenfolk consider them special tokens meant for their use, and no one else’s.  \n_**Flightless but Bold.**_ Though they have no wings and normally cannot fly, the physiology of ravenfolk is strikingly similar to that of true avians. They stand roughly 5 ft. tall and, because of their hollow bones, weigh just 95-105 lb. Albino ravenfolk are found in southern climates.  \nRavenfolk eat almost anything, but they prefer raw meat and field grains, such as corn, soy, and alfalfa. They even scavenge days-old carrion, a practice that repulses most other humanoids.  \n_**Feather Speech.**_ The huginn have their own language, and they have another language which they may use as well: the language of feathers, also known as Feather Speech or Pinion. Ravenfolk can communicate volumes without speaking a word through the dyeing, arrangement, preening, and rustling of their plumage. This language is inherent to ravenfolk and not teachable to unfeathered races."

When a potential victim comes near enough, the rusalki entangles the person with her hair and drags him or her beneath the water to drown.  \n**Lover’s Walks.** A rusalka cannot pass for human on any but the darkest night, but she might claim to be a lonely tree spirit or a benevolent nymph willing to grant a wish in exchange for a kiss. She may part the water of a lake and coax her victim toward the center with the promise of a kiss—delivered as her hair entraps the victim and the water rushes around him. Alternatively, she may use water walk so she and the victim can stroll across the surface of the water, reward him with a long kiss (to prevent him from catching a deep breath), then end the spell over deep water and drag him to the bottom.  \n**Undead Nature.** A rusalka doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Visiting the mortal world each night, sandmen ensure that their targets slumber deeply and experience vivid dreams that swell the dream realm’s power. Some sandmen develop a talent for a specific flavor of dream; fantasies of lost love or childhood, prophecies and religious visions, or terrible nightmares.  \n**Abduct Dreamers.** Powerful dreamers attract both the attention and the protection of sandmen: children, madmen, would-be tyrants, and heroes. They protect such charges fiercely but have also been known to abduct them, taking them on wild adventures to inspire yet greater dreams. To them, all dreams are vital and good, be they uplifting or terrifying. Although they bring horrific nightmares as well as idyllic dreams, sandmen are not specifically baneful. Their actions are motivated by their connection to the dream realm, not by concerns over good and evil.  \n**Ethereal Dreamscapes.** When not on the Material Plane, sandmen ride bubble-like dreamscapes through the Ethereal Plane, breaching the Sea of Possibilities, nurturing and harvesting its contents. Sandmen are a common and welcome sight in markets across the Fey Realms, elemental planes, and even in Hell—anywhere that dreams or nightmares are a valuable commodity. They are merciless to any who threaten the sanctity of dreams, but especially dream eaters."

These bones resemble a sun-bleached ribcage so perfectly that it attracts carrion birds—and curious travelers. When prey passes between the “ribs,” the sandwyrm snaps the rows of bone tightly over its prey. Once its victim is restrained, the sandwyrm paralyzes its meal with repeated stings before carrying it away.  \n**Torpid and Slow.** Sandwyrms sometimes wait for weeks in torpid hibernation before footsteps on the sand alert it to a fresh meal approaching. To guard against lean weeks, sandwyrms store excess prey in subterranean lairs. They’re not above eating carrion if fresh meat isn’t available. When outmatched in a fight, sandwyrms retreat to their lairs with their paralyzed prety.  \n**Peculiar Drakes.** Sandwyrms evolved as an offshoot to drakes or wyverns rather than from true dragons; their anatomy suggests they were originally four-limbed creatures and that their forearms are recent additions to the animal’s body. The bones on their backs may have once been wings, so that sandwyrms are the remnants of some primordial, winged reptiles that migrated to the deep deserts."

Though typically Small, the larger the sap source is, the larger the resulting creature can be. Over a few hours, they pool into a shape that vaguely resembles their tree’s attacker: for instance, if the tree cutter wore a hat, then a hat may be incorporated into the sap demon’s overall shape. The similarity is faint at best; no one would ever confuse a sap demon for the creature it hunts, because its shape has no sharp features or color other than amber.  \n**Called to Vengeance.** Sap demons can pummel their prey with partially-crystallized fists, but they especially enjoy claiming the weapon that wounded their tree and wielding it to deliver a final blow. Once their prey is destroyed, most sap demons return to their tree, but not all do. Some are curious or malevolent enough to explore the world further.  \n**Reckless Possessors.** A sap demon can possess another creature by grappling it and oozing down its throat. Once inside, the sap demon dominates its host and makes it bleed as the tree bled. Since the sap demon takes no damage when its host is wounded, it’s free to be as reckless as it likes. It might wander into a town to cause trouble. However, no matter how its new body is bandaged or cured, it never stops bleeding slowly. If the host body is killed, the sap demon oozes out during the next hour and either returns to its tree or seeks another host."

They seethe with baleful energy, and their blackened skulls retain a simple watchfulness.  \n**Muddled Origins.** Many sages speculate that the first sarcophagus slime was spawned accidentally, in a mummy creation ritual that gave life to the congealed contents of canopic jars rather than the intended, mummified body. Others maintain sarcophagus slime was created by a powerful necromancer-pharaoh bent on formulating the perfect alchemical sentry to guard his crypt.  \n**Death to Tomb Robbers.** These ectoplasmic slimes are the bane of burglars and a constant danger for excavators and antiquarians exploring ruins or tombs. The rituals for their creation have not been entirely lost; modern necromancers still create these undead abominations for their own fell purposes, and tomb robbers are turned into slimes if they lack proper caution.  \n**Undead Nature.** A sarcophagus slime doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Hunger doesn’t explain their attacks, since savagers eat only part of their kills before abandoning the meal and looking for other animals to attack. Some dark forest spirit drives them.  \n**Gnaws Itself.** When there are no other creatures nearby to attack, a savager gnaws on its own forelimbs, resulting in scabs, scars, and calluses so thick and numb that they protect the savager from even the sharpest of swords.  \n**Rare Meetings.** The only creature a savager won’t attack on sight is another savager. If they are of the same sex, the two avoid each out of self-preservation, and if they’re of the opposite sex, they mate so ferociously that both creatures are left wounded, angry, and hungry. A savager litter contains anywhere from 10 to 25 cubs, all of them born able to walk and fend for themselves. This is important, because within 24 hours after giving birth, a savager mother no longer recognizes her own offspring, and she will attack and cannibalize any that don’t escape on their own.  \nA savager weighs 1,800 pounds and is 11 feet long."

When an attacker successfully cuts off the beard, the scheznyki loses access to all spell-like and spell casting abilities—and the beard hair itself is valuable in making potion inks.  \nIf the scheznyki loses its hat and beard at the same time, it falls into a deep, wasting coma and dies in 24 hours or when next exposed to sunlight. When this occurs, the scheznyki’s body crumbles into dust and blows away one round later. If its beard is magically mended or regrown, or its hat restored to its head before this happens, the scheznyki recovers fully and immediately."

They actively hunt humanoids when possible and also attack other predators to steal their kills—or to kill and eat the predators, then take their kills. Serpopards are not tenacious hunters, however.

Beyond that, little is understood about them.  \n**Cryptic Messages.** Shadow beasts are seldom found in groups, but when they are, they seem to have no difficulty or reluctance about operating and fighting together. They have been known to deliver cryptic and threatening messages, but speaking is difficult for them. At times, they perform arcane rituals with the aid of evil humanoids and the use of dark materials.

It can further dislocate and stretch these joints to alarming lengths.  \n**Bridges and Pools.** The shellycoat can be found in abandoned wells or behind waterfalls, in deep tide pools, or beneath the ice of frozen ponds, but their preferred haunt has always been under bridges. They are most active during nighttime and on heavily overcast days, because of their mortal dread of sunlight.  \nA shellycoat's favored tactic is to lie in wait under the water or ice (or bridge) and surprise its prey. It strikes outward or upward from its hiding place to snatch children, livestock (preferably goats), and lone travelers or fishermen. Prey is dragged down to the shadows and water to be robbed and devoured.  \n**Shining Garments.** A shellycoat will always have fashioned for itself a coat, cloak, or shirt of colored pebbles, glass, and polished river shells. These adornments are crude but beautiful and sometimes magical."

When they expire, they simply wink out and return to the elemental planes.  \n**Seek Strong Hosts.** When a formless spark senses a potential body approaching, it dims its light or enters a metallic object. Sparks prefer to inhabit creatures with high Strength over other possible targets.

They guard their territory jealously, typically claiming a necropolis as the heart of their region.  \nLike all sphinxes, gypsosphinxes enjoy riddles. They rely on magic to solve challenging riddles they can’t solve on their own.  \n_**Night Flyers.**_ Unlike most of their cousins, gypsosphinxes are gifted fliers capable of diving steeply from the night sky to snatch carrion or a sleeping camel. The stroke of midnight has a special but unknown significance for the beasts.  \n_**Foretell Doom.**_ Occasionally, a paranoid noble seeks out a gypsosphinx and entreats the creature to reveal the time and place of his or her death, hoping to cheat fate. A gypsosphinx demands a high price for such a service, including payment in corpses of humans, unusual creatures, or near-extinct species. Even if paid, the gypsosphinx rarely honors its side of the bargain; instead, it turns its death magic against the supplicant, bringing about his or her death then and there."

The largest ones hunt in the dark canopy of temperate and subtropical forests._  \n**Hand-Sized Hunters.** These furry, brown spiders are not enormous monsters, but they are big enough to be alarming. A typical one is as big as a human hand with fingers spread wide, but some grow as large as small dogs.  \n**Webbed Line.** Line spiders don’t spin webs but instead perch and watch for prey. When prey wanders near, the spider launches a line of webbing to snare it, then pounces unerringly along that line to deliver a deep bite. Their potent venom can incapacitate creatures much larger than themselves, and they quickly devour flesh with their powerful jaws.  \n**City Dwellers.** Line spiders are often found in cities, and their size makes them a good replacement for a garroter crab in certain forms of divination. They’re favorites among exotic-pet dealers—usually with their venom sacs removed, sometimes not. Goblins, kobolds, and some humans use them rather than cats to control a mouse or rat infestation, and they make reasonably good pets if they’re kept well-fed. If they get hungry, line spiders may devour other small pets or even their owners."

Spire walkers prefer clothing in metallic hues with many buttons, and they always carry a handful of tiny copper darts that they hurl at each other during their incomprehensible games. When excited, they emit a sparking glow from the tips of their noses, eyebrows, ears, and pointy shoes.  \nThey play rough-and-tumble games among themselves and enjoy pranking bystanders with frightening but mostly harmless electric shocks. If a spire walker perishes during the fun, the others pause just long enough to say “awww, we’ll miss you” and go through their comrade’s pockets before continuing with the game.  \n**Love Copper and Amber.** Spire walkers like gold but they love copper. They prefer it over all other metals, and they keep the copper pieces in their pockets brilliantly polished. They also value amber gems. Among a group of spire walkers, the leader is not the cleverest or most ruthless, but the one displaying the most ostentatious amber jewel."

Only after its victims have been lured away from warmth and safety does the stuhac drop its disguise and show its true nature: the withered traveler's gnarled hands uncurl to reveal jagged yellow claws, its cataract-ridden eyes are exposed as waxen orbs wobbling loosely in their sockets; throwing open its cloak, it proudly shows off woven layers of yellowed tendon and ligament.  \n**Hideous Garments.** The stuhac’s most prized possessions are its “clutters,” garments woven of layered and tangled ligaments and tendons. These grisly trophies are taken from scores of victims, and stuhacs treasure each bit of their disgusting attire. When two stuhac meet, they compare their garb, swapping anecdotes of their most horrifying kills and deceptions.  \nStuhacs weave new ligaments into their clutters while their still-living victims watch. Lying in crippled agony, they cannot flee as the stuhac tears fresh material from their bodies for its garments. To keep screams from disturbing their work, these monsters sever their victim’s vocal chords.  \n**Devour Victims.** Once its clutters are done, the stuhac feeds on its live victim, devouring everything but the bones. Finding a clean-picked humanoid skeleton along a mountain path is a reliable sign of a stuhac’s presence.  \nBecause female stuhacs have never been reported, some believe that these fiends mate with demons, hags, or lamias. Others believe stuhacs are part of a hideous malediction, a recipe for immortality that requires the subject to devour its own kind."

They are 9 feet tall, average 700 lb., and can live up to 300 years.  \nDuring the dry season, subek are friendly, thoughtful scholars, historians, and artisans.  \n**Flood Fever.** Subek are well aware of their destructive and violent nature. When the waters rise, they distance themselves from other cultures, warning locals to keep away until the river recedes. Most migrate up or down river to an area with few inhabitants; some even construct underground prisons or cages and pay brave retainers to keep them locked up and fed during their time of savagery.  \nDuring flood fever, subek do not recognize friends or colleagues. They discard all trappings of civilization and kill nonsubek creatures indiscriminately. Once the fever clears, they remember nothing of their actions, though they are surrounded by undeniable, grisly reminders.  \n**Keep Their Distance.** Despite the danger, subek are tolerated and even prized for their skill as engineers, historians, and teachers. They live on the outskirts of many human towns, maintaining a cautious distance from their neighbors. Subek marriage is pragmatic; they live with a mate long enough to foster a single egg and raise the hatchling for a decade before parting ways.  \nSubek scholars and oracles debate their duality. Some believe it to be an ancient curse, a shared ancestry with northern trolls, or some loathsome and primitive part of their soul exerting control. A rare few—shamans and oracles, mostly—embrace their duality and choose to live year-round in remote regions far from civilization."

Some say the old woods hide nothing but liars, and that is why the deepest forest is shrouded in silence. Others say that the forest uses sutureflies to smother those who break its covenants or reveal its secrets.  \nAdventurers see a suturefly’s handiwork more often than they glimpse one of the creatures directly: corpses with mouths and noses stitched shut lie in the underbrush, mysterious children whose mouths are ringed with black puncture marks observe intruders from afar, and dryads step from trees, their eyes sewn shut against the evils of civilization.  \n**Seek Out Curses.** Numerous suturefly varieties exist. Some attack based on verbal triggers other than lies. Black‑banded sutureflies, for instance, detect curses and religious blasphemies.  \nWhen attacking, sutureflies dart from hiding to gain surprise. Once they sew someone’s mouth closed, they target the same victim’s nose, unless threatened by another opponent. Sutureflies attack until they have sewn all of their opponents’ mouths, eyes and noses closed or until they’re destroyed."

Fire dancers possess (and some argue are infected with) mortal qualities—they seek to reach a greater potential, which smacks of envy, ambition, and resentment. They realize that there is power in numbers and that, when united, they are a force to be reckoned with. A single fire dancer is no more threatening than a tiny candle flame, burning hot and blue. When thousands join together, though, the result is an inferno. The likeness of a skull in its flame is an illusion created by the creature, based on how the fire dancers perceive mortal creatures after they’re done with them.  \n_**Surly Servants.**_ Lone fire dancers have individuality, but in groups, they develop a hive mentality. While this allows them to function as a swarm, it also makes them vulnerable as a group to mind-affecting magic. Savvy bards, conjurers, and enchanters who summon swarms of fire dancers know they must maintain a tight control on the swarm, for these creatures are surly servants at the best of times.  \n_**Elemental Nature.**_ A swarm of fire dancers doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Greenish bronze temple dogs are known, as are those the color of cinnabar or lapis. Even coats resembling fired ceramic of an orange hue have been seen guarding some temples. These unusual casts make it easy for a temple dog to be mistaken for statuary.  \n**Travel with Priests.** As a temple protector, it rarely leaves the grounds of the temple to which it has been attached, but temple dogs do accompany priests or allies of the temple during travel. The temple dog cannot speak but understands most of what’s said around it, and it can follow moderately complex commands (up to two sentences long) without supervision.  \nTemple dogs are notorious for biting their prey, then shaking the victim senseless in their massive jaws."

While they are easily distracted, they always find their way home unerringly.  \n**Insane and Moody.** Degenerate titans are prone to insanity and unexpected mood shifts. They are fiercely territorial creatures who worship the still-active magical devices of their cities and any surviving statuary as if they were gods. Their lairs are filled with items scavenged from the city. These collections are a hodgepodge of dross and delight, as the degenerate titans are not intelligent enough to discern treasure from trash.  \n**Primal Power.** Degenerate titans cannot command magical words of power, but they have tapped into the earth's latent mystic power to generate strange geomancy. These devolved misfits may have lost most of their former gifts, but what remains are primal powers that tap, without subtlety or skill, into the fundamental building blocks of magic."

        "desc": "The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places—quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.  \nThose few tosculi who do not hear their queen’s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.  \n_This humanoid wasp’s gossamer wings beat out a soft, droning buzz. Flashing blades sing in each of her four clawed hands, and the air around her crackles with arcane energy._  \n**Center of the Hive.** The hive-queen is the nerve center of a tosculi hive-city, simultaneously one of a hive’s greatest strengths and weaknesses. The hive-queen serves as a unifying force. She binds her swarm with an ironclad sense of purpose through the hive mind, the psychic web that links all tosculi within a hive.  \n**Deadly Inheritance.** A hive-queen typically has several immature daughters as her potential heirs at any given time. When she nears the end of her life, the hive-queen selects the most promising of her heirs and feeds her a special concoction. This speeds the heir’s maturation and makes her ready to become a full-fledged hive-queen. The daughter’s first action upon assuming power and control over the hive-city is to devour her mother and all her sisters.  \n**Hive Chaos.** If a hive-queen dies with no heir to anchor the hive mind, the city plunges into chaos. Tosculi bereft of the hivemind go berserk. A few fortunate ones might escape and become lone renegades, but their existence without the comforting presence of the hive is miserable and short. Unless one of the hive-queen’s daughters is mature enough and ruthless enough to step in and assert control, the hive is doomed.  \n\n## A Tosculi Hive-Queen’s Lair\n\n  \nHive-queens make their lairs in the most protected part of the hive. Huge corridors lead to this point, so all tosculi can reach their queen as quickly as possible. This is also the place where tosculi eggs hatch, making it a critical location for the survival of the hive. A tosculi hive-queen encountered in her lair has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP), but nothing else in her stat block changes.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive-queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:\n* The tosculi hive-queen releases a cloud of pheromones that drives the tosculi to fight harder. All tosculi within 60 feet of the hive-queen (including the hive-queen herself) regain 7 (2d6) hit points.\n* A swarm of tiny tosculi offspring crawls from its nest and attacks a creature within 120 feet of the hive-queen, automatically doing 10 (4d4) piercing damage. Then the swarm dies.\n* The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be encased in rapidly-hardening resin. A creature encased this way is restrained. It can free itself, or another creature within 5 feet can free it, by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the creature is still encased the next time the initiative count reaches 20, the resin hardens, trapping it. The trapped creature can’t move or speak; attack rolls against it have disadvantage because it is encased in resin armor; it automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws; and it has resistance to all damage. The trapped creature is released when the resin is destroyed (AC 10, 20 HP, immune to cold, fire, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, and piercing damage).\n  \nThe tosculi hive-queen can’t repeat an effect until they have all been used, and she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.  \n\n## Regional Effects\n\n  \nThe region containing a tosculi hive-queen’s lair is warped by the creature’s presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:  \n\\# Intelligent creatures within 6 miles suffer frequent headaches. It’s as if they had a constant buzzing inside their heads.  \n\\# Beasts within 6 miles are more irritable and violent than usual and have the Blood Frenzy trait:  \n**Blood Frenzy.** The beast has advantage on melee attack rolls against a creature that doesn’t have all its hit points. If the tosculi hive-queen dies, the buzzing disappears immediately, and the beasts go back to normal within 1d10 days."

Beneath any of these facades may lurk a treacle waiting to feed on a gullible victim, mewling and cooing all the while. Whether by natural selection or arcane tampering, these compact oozes prey on kindness._  \n**Diet of Blood.** Treacles feed on blood but lack the natural weapons or acid of larger slimes. To survive, prey must welcome and embrace them, unaware of the threat. The treacles’ soft bodies absorb psychic impressions and take the shape of unthreatening creatures. In the wild, treacles assume the form of an animal’s offspring to lie close for several hours.  \n**Pet Polymorph.** Among humanoids, treacles transform into pets, infants, or injured animals. In the most horrific cases, these oozes resemble children’s toys. Treacles don’t choose their forms consciously, but instead rely on a primitive form of telepathy to sense which shapes a potential victim finds least threatening or most enticing. They can hold a new shape for several hours, even if the intended victim is no longer present.  \n**Slow Drain.** Once they have assumed a nonthreatening form, treacles mewl, sing, or make pitiful noises to attract attention. Once they’re in contact with a potential victim, treacles drain blood slowly, ideally while their prey sleeps or is paralyzed. If threatened or injured, treacles flee. A sated treacle detaches from its victim host and seeks a cool, dark place to rest and digest. With enough food and safety, a treacle divides into two fully-grown oozes. Rarely, a mutation prevents this division, so that the sterile treacle instead grows in size. The largest can mimic human children and the elderly.  \nTreacles are small, weighing less than six lb. Their natural forms are pale and iridescent, like oil on fresh milk, but they’re seldom seen this way."

Their gnarled trunks are often twisted, and their wood often groans when they move.  \n**Forest Wardens.** Weeping treants are protectors of dark, shadowy forests, and they are as long-lived as the trees themselves. They act as guardians for an entire forest or for something specific within the forest—they have no pity for those carrying axes or fire.  \n**Skeptical Mein.** Weeping treants are terrifying and relentless when fighting in defense of their charge. They are inherently distrustful, particularly of anything not of the natural or shadow world, and they’re notoriously difficult to fool or deceive.  \n**Enchanted Bitter Tears.** Sages and scholars debate why these creatures weep, but no one has come forward with a compelling reason beyond “it’s what trees do.” The weeping treants themselves refuse to speak on the matter. Their tears are occasionally components in druidic spells or items."

Devious, manipulative, and mischievous, they toy with their prey before killing it. They rarely enjoy a stand-up fight, instead coalescing in and out of the fog to harass victims. Using their ability to solidify and poison the fog around them, they cut large groups into smaller, more manageable morsels.  \n**Dreary Marshlands.** Their tactics have earned vapor lynxes a nasty reputation and the occasional bounty on their heads. Additionally, their magical nature makes them valuable to practitioners of the magical arts, and their beautiful, thick coats tempt many a furrier into hunts they may not be prepared for. For these reasons, vapor lynxes avoid civilization, fearing organized reprisal. Instead they haunt marshes and swamps, where the natural fog makes hunting easier. If an intelligent humanoid passes their way, they are happy for a change in their diet.  \n**Chatty with Dinner.** Although reclusive, vapor lynxes are intelligent, speaking both Common and Sylvan. They are particularly prideful and take great joy in bantering with potential meals to belittle and frighten them. Survivors of vapor lynx encounters invariably mention their constant needling and self-aggrandizement."

They demand oaths from interlopers and enforce them fiercely. Vila delight in testing the virtue of travelers and tormenting the uncharitable and cruel with bad weather and misfortune. Particularly obnoxious adventurers might suffer bad luck for months because a troop of vila quietly dances around their camp each night.  \n**Hunt with a Pack.** Vila rarely travel or fight alone; they are often seen in the company of alseid, wolves, wampus cats, or deer. In combat, they sometimes ride on fleet-footed deer, the better to escape if events turn against them."

Known as barbers for both the use of wicked blades and their proclivity for slashing the necks of their victims, these insidious fey can be found lurking in dark and harrowed places like back-alley streets or abandoned, deep-shaded cemeteries.  \n_**Fey Punishers.**_ Called the siabhra (pronounced she-uvh-ra) among the fey courts, vile barbers are fickle creatures. They are sent to punish those who have offended the fey lords and ladies, and their cruelty and cunning help them write messages in blood and skin. At the very least, they scar those who have spoken ill of the fey; those who have harmed or murdered the fey are more likely to be bled slowly. Some of these deaths are made quite public—though in a few cases, the victim is enchanted to remain invisible while the siabhra does its bloody work.  \n_**Slippery Fighters.**_ A vile barber often uses its ability to step through shadows to steal a victim’s weapon and use it against its former owner with devastating effect. Any creature grappled by a vile barber is at the mercy of the barber’s sinister and unclean weapons—they delight in close combat.  \n_**Assassins and Envoys.**_ Vile barbers frequently consort with hags and prowl the places these wicked crones cannot go as emissaries and assassins. Information on the siabhra is scant; most adventurers who meet them don’t live to share their findings or to see the vile barber lick its bloody blade clean."

She is particularly fond of attacking bathers or those pulling water from a stream.  \n**Hatred of the Holy.** While she prefers to feast on intelligent male humanoids, she holds a special animosity toward and hunger for holy men of any kind. Unless near starvation or if provoked, however, she will not kill women. Indeed, a wampus cat may strike up a temporary friendship with any woman who is having difficulties with men, though these friendships typically last only as long as their mutual enemies live. Some witches are said to command gain their trust and keep them as companions.  \n**Swamp Team Ups.** Will-o’-wisps and miremals enjoy working in tandem with wampus cats; the wisps alter their light to mimic the flicker of a torch or candle and illuminate the disguised cat, the better to lure in victims, then assist the cat in the ensuing battle. Miremals use a tall story to lure travelers into a swamp when the hour grows late, then abandon them."

        "desc": "_This tiny ball of bright light seems to emanate from a crystalline center._  \n**Wizard Servants.** Also called a “spooklight,” a witchlight is a wizard’s servant created from a tiny piece of quartz. It appears as a floating ball of flickering light similar to a will-o’-wisp. The hue of quartz used during the creature’s creation determines the color of each witchlight’s illumination. After the quartz is prepared, it is animated through an extended magical ritual cast under a full moon and a clear, starry sky. Consequently, they are extremely rare by any measure.  \n**Flashing Light Code.** A witchlight always shares the same alignment as its creator. Although it cannot speak, a witchlight understands Common or another language taught it by its creator. Many spellcasters have taught their witchlights a coded cipher, so it can spell out words by flaring and dimming its light. When necessary, a witchlight can spell words in the air by flying so quickly that its trail of light forms letters. This stunt requires a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check per word.  \n**Free Roaming.** If the witchlight’s master dies within one mile of the witchlight, it explodes in a brilliant but harmless flash of light. If it loses its master under any other circumstance, it becomes masterless; it’s free to do as it pleases, and it can never serve anyone else as a familiar. The statistics below represent these independent witchlights.  \nEvil witchlights can be surprisingly cruel, not unlike will-o’wisps. They seek to lure lost travelers into swamps or traps by using their glow to imitate the light of a safe haven. Conversely, good-aligned witchlights guide travelers to places of safety or along safe paths, and they are prized by pilots and guides. Neutral witchlights exhibit a playful nature—sometimes mingling inside the cavities of weapons, gems, or other curiosities, which means those items may be mistaken for magic items. More than one “wizard’s staff ” is just an impressivelooking stick with a witchlight perched on top.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A witchlight doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep."

Its head resembles a massive boulder, and its 200-foot long flippers are mistaken for reefs.  \n**Ageless Slumber.** Zaratans spend their millennia-long lives in slumber. They drift on the surface of the ocean, their mouths slightly open, and reflexively swallow larger creatures that explore the “cave.” They spend centuries at a time asleep. A zaratan may know secrets long lost to the world, if only it can be awakened and bargained with.  \n**Deep Divers.** Waking a zaratan is a dangerous proposition, as their usual response to any injury severe enough to waken them is to dive to the crushing black depths. Some zaratan commune with oceanic races in this time, such as deep ones, sahuagin, or aboleth."

Rumors suggest the heart of an ancient forest itself can control the actions of these beasts, while others believe that they have a pact with certain forest druids. Certainly they are clever enough, often destroying bridges, dams, or logging camps infringing on their territory.  \n**Solitary Hunters.** Zmey avoid their own kind, seeking out isolated hunting grounds. They eat any organic matter, but they favor the fresh meat of large birds and mammals. The smarter the prey, the better, because zmey believe that intellect flavors the meat. They consider alseids, halflings, and gnomes especially succulent.  \n**Three-Headed Rage.** Dappled black and green scales cover this enormous beast and its three towering necks are long and powerful. Each neck is topped with an identical, menacing head, and each head is flanked by spiny, frilled membranes. A forked tongue flickers across long pale teeth, and six pairs of eyes burn red with rage.  \nWhen a zmey stands upright, it measures 25 feet from snout to tail. The beast weighs over 9,000 lb."

A zmey headling eats everything it can, including its previous body, to satisfy its intense, maddening hunger and sustain its regeneration. Many stories about the horrific violence of the zmey are reports of voracious headlings, not mature zmey."
