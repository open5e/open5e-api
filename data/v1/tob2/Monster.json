Its limbs end in large, grasping claws that look strong enough to crush the life out of a bear._  \n**Hidden Terror.** The dreaded a-mi-kuk is a terrifying creature that feasts on any who venture into the bleak and icy expanses of the world. A-mi-kuks prowl the edges of isolated communities, snatching those careless enough to wander too far from camp. They also submerge themselves beneath frozen waters, coming up from below to grab and strangle lone fishermen.  \n**Fear of Flames.** A-mi-kuks have a deathly fear of fire, and anyone using fire against one has a good chance of making it flee in terror, even if the fire-user would otherwise be outmatched. A-mi-kuks are not completely at the mercy of this fear, however, and lash out with incredible fury if cornered by someone using fire against them.  \n**Unknown Origins.** A-mi-kuks are not natural creatures and contribute little to the ecosystems in which they live. The monsters are never seen together, and some believe them to be a single monster, an evil spirit made flesh that appears whenever a group of humans has angered the gods. A-mi-kuks have no known allies and viciously attack any creatures that threaten them, regardless of the foe\u2019s size or power.",

While not evil, the aalpamac is a ravenous and territorial creature, ranging over an area of up to a dozen miles in search of fresh meat. Aalpamacs are not picky about what they consume and even attack large boats if sufficiently hungry. They are solitary creatures and tolerate others of their own kind only during mating seasons.  \n**Local Legends.** An aalpamac that terrorizes the same lake or river for many years often develops a reputation among the locals of the area, particularly those living along the body of water in question. Inevitably, this gives rise to a number of stories exaggerating the size, ferocity, disposition, or powers of the aalpamac. The stories often give aalpamacs names that highlight their most prominent features or are specific to the area in which they live, such as \u201cChompo\u201d or \u201cthe Heron Lake Monster.\u201d These stories also make the aalpamac the target of adventurers and trophy hunters, most of whom either do not locate the beast or fall victim to it.",

Most abbanith giants wear simple tunics or shorts woven of a strange subterranean fungus, though leaders occasionally wear armor.  \n**Consummate Diggers.** Abbanith giants dwell almost exclusively underground and are adept at using their incredibly hard thumb claws to dig massive tunnels through the earth. Druids and wizards studying the giants\u2019 unique biology have deduced that mineral-based materials actually soften when struck by their claws. This feature has also made them the target of derro and duergar slavers wishing to use their skills to mine precious gems or build their fortifications, something the giants violently oppose despite their normally peaceable nature.  \n**Allies of the Earth.** For as long as either race can remember, abbanith giants have been allies of the Open Game License",

Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food.

Although a few wizards have discovered magical methods of summoning them, none have found a way to control or communicate with them. Akaasits seem to be drawn to spellcasters with some mastery of time magic, though it is always a gamble if an individual akaasit will protect or ruthlessly attack such a spellcaster. An akaasit\u2019s demeanor can change each day, and many time magic spellcasters have been found slain by the same akaasit that faithfully protected them the day prior.  \n**Dispersed Destruction.** If an akaasit is destroyed, it falls apart into a pile of gray triangles. These triangles fade out of existence over the next ten minutes, leaving only the akaasit\u2019s two armblades.  \n**Construct Nature.** The akaasit doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Easily bored, akhluts crave stimulation and are known to follow ships and caravans for miles in the hopes that someone might provide something new or exciting to experience. They can be especially mischievous, freeing fish and game from traps purely to hunt he creatures themselves.  \n**Dangerous Steeds.** The akhlut\u2019s natural power, intelligence, and versatility make them incredibly desirable mounts, but the effort to tame one of these creatures is dangerous and not to be taken lightly.

Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food.

Their sole concern is their own comfort, and they use their natural gifts to force nearby humanoids to tend to their wants and needs. Young august roosters are brazen about their collections of servants, often working the servants to exhaustion with constant demands.

As the world thawed, avalanche screamers fled to mountain peaks and polar regions to hunt smaller prey. Avalanche screamer lairs contain a jumble of bones from their victims but have no other commonalities.  \n**Devious Hunter.** A versatile predator, the avalanche screamer can attack its prey from the ground beneath or from cliffs and trees above. It prefers to pick off its victims one at a time, grabbing stragglers at the back of a group and killing them before returning to the group. When it must face multiple foes simultaneously, it uses its scream to inflict harm on as many targets as possible. In unstable areas, the sound can cause avalanches, which the avalanche screamer rides out unscathed. It then uses its ability to detect vibrations to locate survivors, tunnel its way toward them, and devour them.  \n**Summer Hibernation.** Because avalanche screamers become lethargic and vulnerable in warmer temperatures, they hide themselves during the brief summers in their mountaintop and polar habitats. In preparation for their summer slumbers, they aggressively hunt prey, fattening themselves or stockpiling in their lairs. As a precaution against hunters that might follow them to their lairs, avalanche screamers often collect their food from miles away and tunnel through the ground to leave no tracks. Those who manage to track the creatures and hope to easily dispatch them while they are sluggish find avalanche screamers quickly shake their torpor to defend themselves.",

When they are not skulking in the dark, the citizenry ignores them as they would any other drifter. They linger around taverns, theaters, and other places the living visit for entertainment. Sometimes the sight and sound of merriment rouses the bleakhearts from cold despair to hot rage. The resulting carnage invariably leads to the destruction of the originating bleakheart and the creation of several new ones.  \n**Familiar Faces.** A bleakheart gains grim satisfaction in causing distress to the living, especially those who have recently experienced joy. By day, they lurk in deeply shadowed areas of settlements, usually around places of entertainment, and skim the thoughts of passersby. When a bleakheart detects someone who is elated, it follows them home for further observation. While its victim sleeps, the bleakheart probes their mind, causing the victim nightmares about the subject of their happiness. Once the victim awakens, its joy turned to pain, the bleakheart disguises itself as the personage who once brought the victim joy and reveals itself. Even while magically disguised, a bleakheart appears disquietingly out of focus.  \n**Undead Nature.** A bleakheart doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Its scales are dull and colored to match the surrounding stone. A cave drake hunts by lying in wait for prey to pass, often hanging from a wall or ceiling, before ambushing with its blinding venom. The drake then tracks the blinded creature as it flees, using a keen sense of smell and the creature\u2019s disorientation to follow it. A cave drake will follow prey patiently for miles, unless its quarry wanders into the territory of another cave drake.  \n**Solitary Hunter.** The cave drake is a lone predator. It typically lairs in high-roofed caverns, atop sheer ledges, or in other areas where it can take advantage of its superior climbing ability. Each cave drake claims a wide expanse of tunnels and caverns as its territory. A cave drake will fight to defend its territory from all other creatures, including other cave drakes, with the exception of mating season, when territories fluctuate as female drakes search for mates. A female cave drake will lay two to five eggs, raising the young until they are able to hunt on their own, then driving them out.  \n**Hoards.** Like their true dragon kin, cave drakes collect treasure, favoring shiny metals and sparkling gemstones. They will often arrange such treasures near phosphorescent fungi, glowing crystals, or other sources of light. Unlike true dragons, cave drakes are not overly protective or jealous of their hoards. The more cunning of their kind often use such objects as bait to draw out greedy prey while they wait in ambush.",

Rather than retain the bodily form it possessed in life, the creature\u2019s skin sloughs off from parts of its body as aquatic features burst through its flesh. Its fingers and toes become webbed, and fins form on its back and down its legs.  \n**Decay.** The cavefish zombie\u2019s dead tissue holds water, causing it to look bloated and loose and afflicting it with a persistent rot. This rot results in a horrific odor, which follows them whether they are in water or on land.  \n**Undead Nature.** A cavefish zombie doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

When the victim opens the box, the chatterlome springs forth, claiming the heart of the victim and fulfilling the supplicant\u2019s request. Whether or not the box is opened, a chatterlome whose box has been delivered knows the location of the victim and tracks the person relentlessly.

Water drips from the claws, freezing before it hits the ground._  \n**Forlorn Spirits.** Chill haunts arise from the corpses of humanoids that froze to death. While most chill haunts derive from those who died alone in the cold, stories tell of entire families or villages returning as chill haunts. Because of the intensity of their demise, chill haunts dread cold and flee when targeted by cold magic.  \n**Hungry for Body Heat.** The chill haunt\u2019s disdain for cold leads it to seek out warm buildings or open fires. While ambient heat or direct contact with fire diminishes its shivering and restores wounds it has received in combat, it craves heat from living creatures. Contact with the chill haunt sets off a deepening freeze in the victim, which is hard to reverse without the application of fire. The haunt comes into contact with living creatures to remember the feeling of warmth, and it does not care about the side effects of its touch. After it has drained the warmth from one creature, it immediately moves on to the next, ever-hungry.  \n**Restless Undead.** Destroying a chill haunt is only a temporary solution to the undead creature\u2019s depredations. Similar to a ghost, a destroyed chill haunt returns to unlife 24 hours after its demise, attaining eternal rest only after being slain under a specific set of circumstances. For most chill haunts, the surest way to eternal rest is by coaxing the haunt to a warm building where it can sit by a hearth and nestle in blankets or furs. Though physical objects normally pass through the spectral creature, such conditions allow the coverings to conform to the shape of the haunt\u2019s former body. Moments later, the haunt lets out a contented sigh and winks out of existence.  \n**Undead Nature.** A chill haunt doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

The leeches are designed to extract their fill and return to their controllers, who access and drain their reservoirs. Autonomous clockwork leeches continue to collect blood, but, without masters to whom they deliver it, they go through cycles of draining blood then violently disgorging it. Regardless of their purpose (or lack thereof) for obtaining blood, most clockwork leeches retreat after getting their fill.  \n**Waterproof Swimmer.** A clockwork leech has layered copper plating that keeps water away from its inner mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the leech to propel itself through water. They can use this propelling undulation on land to make attacks with their \u201ctails.\u201d Leeches that don\u2019t receive regular cleanings eventually turn green as the copper corrodes.  \n**Unseen, Unheard, and Unfelt.** The same plating that protects the clockwork leech\u2019s inner mechanisms also buffers noise from the gears. Its coloration allows it to blend in with marshland foliage and silty water. Finally, when it punctures a creature\u2019s skin, it releases a sedative to numb the wound, leaving the victim unaware of the injury and subsequent blood drain. The leech doesn\u2019t have an unlimited supply of the sedative, and a leech that hasn\u2019t undergone maintenance for a few weeks loses its Anesthetizing Bite trait. Because the leech must remain attached to its victim to drain its blood, it prefers to attack lone or sleeping targets.  \n**Construct Nature.** A clockwork leech doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Some intelligent undead tame and train corpse worms, using them as pets, guardians, or shock troops.  \n**Slimy Eggs.** A female corpse worm lays up to two dozen eggs in crevasses, cul-de-sacs, or other remote areas. Corpse worm eggs are about the size of a human head and are sheathed in a rubbery, translucent gray membrane. The eggs are deposited with a sticky, mustard-colored excretion, allowing them to be placed on walls or even ceilings. This excretion exudes a powerful smell that many subterranean predators find unpleasant, and it allows the mother to relocate the eggs as she watches over them until they hatch.",

Unlike dryads, crinaea can choose to be bound to a water source and can change which water source they call home. A crinaea must submerge itself in its bound water source every day or suffer. As long as the water source stays pure and the crinaea never travels more than a mile from it, the crinaea can live indefinitely. If its home water source is ever dried up or destroyed, the crinaea quickly fades until it finds a new home or dies.  \n**Friendly but Poisonous.** One of the most gregarious fey, the crinaea enjoys long conversations with intelligent creatures. The crinaea is often well-versed in the goings-on around its home and happily shares such information with friendly creatures. It offers its pure water to those in need and those who are polite, but woe be unto those who anger the fey after having tasted its water, as the crinaea can poison any water taken from its home.",

Two translucent horns protrude from its snout, the frontmost of which looks like a scimitar._  \n**Elemental-Touched Rhino.** A cryoceros resembles a woolly rhinoceros made of ice. Its thick, frozen hide protects the soft flesh at its core, and a layer of ice forms over its already formidable, keratinous horns. The creature\u2019s body is efficient at transferring warmth to its fleshy interior; fire still harms a cryoceros, but its icy form is not unduly damaged by fiery attacks. A cryoceros has a second stomach that stores ice it consumes. As a defense mechanism, the cryoceros can spew stinging, pulverized ice from this alternate stomach.  \n**Slow Metabolisms.** Cryoceroses survive on stunted grasses and other plants that thrive in the tundra, as well as ice and snow, to replenish their icy exteriors. Despite their size, they don\u2019t require a great deal of sustenance, and they conserve their energy by slowly grazing across frozen plains. Their ponderous movement fools the unwary into believing that distance equals safety. Indeed, cryoceroses endure much provocation before they decide to act, but they run at and spear or crush those who irritate them. Once their ire is up, they rarely give up pursuing the source of their anger; only by leaving their vast territories can one hope to escape them.  \n**Cantankerous Mounts.** Gentleness and a regular source of food temporarily earns the cryoceroses\u2019 trust, and patient humanoids can manage to train the creatures to accept riders. This works for convenience much more than for combat, since cryoceroses balk at fighting with loads on their backs. A cryoceros in combat with a rider either stands stock still until its rider dismounts or, worse, rolls over to throw its rider, often crushing the rider in the process. Because of this, most tribes who train cryoceroses use the creatures as beasts of burden rather than war mounts.",

    "desc": "The cavern glitters with refracted light bouncing off thousands of crystals. A towering menhir of shimmering crystal dominates the center of the cavern._  \nWhether a rare evolution of silicate life or a wandering nomadic race from some alternate reality, crystalline monoliths are enigmatic beings found deep underground in caverns where giant crystals flourish and grow.  \n**Crystal Gardens.** Crystalline monoliths reside in areas of living crystal, these formations often growing to gigantic proportions, resembling the monolith itself. Some sages speculate that crystalline monoliths grow crystals to certain specifications, then use their magic to instill sentience in the crystals as a means of reproducing. Whether the gardens are for reproduction or some other mysterious purpose, the crystal monoliths are very protective of them. The environment of these gardens is often not comfortable for most humanoid life; the temperature may be extremely hot or cold, or the cavern may contain poisonous gases or even be partially-submerged in water.  \n**Magical Philosophers.** Crystalline monoliths prefer to spend their days in quiet contemplation. They tend their crystal gardens and meditate. If encountered by other intelligent creatures, they are generally open to exchanges of information and intellectual discussion. They prefer to communicate telepathically but can create sounds through vibrations that mimic speech. Aggressive intruders are dealt with according to the level of threat they exhibit. If the crystalline monolith considers the intruders unlikely to cause it harm, it will often use its magic to misdirect opponents or lure them away from the garden. Should the intruders persist or show themselves to be dangerous, a crystalline monolith is not above using its magic to crush and destroy them. It is especially unforgiving to those that try to steal or damage crystals in its lair.  \n**Crystalline Nature.** A crystalline monolith doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.  \n\n## A Crystalline Monolith\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nCrystalline monoliths lair in vast gardens of crystal in mountains or deep underground, often near areas of extreme temperature or geothermal activity. They harness the ambient magical energy in the crystals to defend themselves and repel intruders.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the crystalline monolith takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the crystalline monolith can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The crystalline monolith creates an illusory duplicate of itself in its space. The double moves or speaks according to the monolith\u2019s mental direction. Each time a creature targets the monolith with an attack, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets the duplicate. On a roll of 11 or higher, the attack hits and destroys the duplicate. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine which monolith is real. On a success, the creature identifies the illusion. The duplicate is intangible, but otherwise is identical to the monolith by sight, smell, or hearing. The duplicate lasts for 1 minute or until the monolith uses this lair action again.\n* The crystalline monolith vibrates at a frequency that reverberates through the lair, causing the ground to tremble. Each creature on the ground within 60 feet of the monolith (except for the crystalline monolith itself) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n* Magically-charged shards of crystal fire from the crystals in the lair, striking up to two targets within 60 feet of the crystalline monolith. The crystalline monolith makes one ranged attack roll (+3 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and 2 (1d4) psychic damage.",

Birthed by such magic, the creature is influenced by both: it loves the arts and is protective of the natural world.  \n**Garden Guardians.** Dancing foliage primarily inhabits and defends forest groves from outside threats, but they sometimes wander the gardens of urban settlements. Their love of flowers causes them to tend and protect the plants at all costs, often to the dismay of the garden\u2019s owner or castle groundskeeper. Once a dancing foliage has decided to protect an area, it refuses to leave, though terms of pruning and planting can be negotiated with it, especially if such actions make the garden more aesthetically pleasing.  \n**Dancing Gardeners.** When tending to its garden, dancing foliage moves to some unheard tune, gracefully leaping, twirling, and bobbing around the garden. If it or its garden is threatened, the dancing foliage enters a battle dance until the threat is either removed or eliminated. It never pursues foes beyond the end of its garden.",

Although they have eyes that can see light normally, their primary means of navigating the darkness is through vibration sense, which they register on their rubbery, sensitive skin.  \n**Malleable.** After these trolls moved underground, their bodies adapted to surviving in the smaller, often cramped caverns. Their bones became soft and malleable, allowing them to access areas deep beneath the surface world. Deep trolls can elongate their limbs and body or squeeze themselves ooze-like through tiny cracks and openings until they emerge into a place large enough to accommodate their natural size.  \n**Tribal.** Deep trolls live in small tribes of seven to fifteen members. They raid in groups, though they can be found alone when hunting or scavenging. They are intelligent enough to communicate, but they are voracious and can rarely be reasoned with when food is present. They prefer to attack anything potentially edible that isn\u2019t part of the tribe and deal with the repercussions later. In rare cases, when confronted with opponents who are clearly more powerful, they can be persuaded to reason and discuss terms. Deep trolls are likely to agree to mutually beneficial terms, such as helping them deal with a common enemy or providing them with something they value.",

Diminution drakes resemble dragons with a long, tubular snouts. Their eyes have red pupils that continually contract from wide spheres to tiny dots and back again. They have subpar vision and hearing but an extraordinary sense of smell.  \n**Shrinking Hunter.** The diminution drake uses the shrinking properties of its toxic breath weapon and stinger to reduce the size of its prey. Once a creature has been reduced in size, the drake uses its spaghetti-like tongue to swallow its prey.  \n**Hunters of Sport.** Diminution drakes can live off of rodents and small animals, but they find great satisfaction in hunting, diminishing, and devouring larger prey. The gut of the drake can digest anything, and digesting a shrunken, armored adventurer is of no consequence. The drake is a cunning hunter, often hiding as a tiny creature to set up ambushes.",

Emperor\u2019s hyenas can be created only from hyenas that were anointed protectors of the god\u2019s holy places when they were alive. Their scarcity means they are primarily used as messengers and guardians for the emperor. The emperor rarely sends them to attack enemies unless the enemy has truly angered him. The emperor is seldom seen without a pair of emperor\u2019s hyenas by his side. When he moves publicly, every available emperor\u2019s hyena is deployed to ensure his safety.  \n**Voice of the Emperor.** Emperor\u2019s hyenas often deliver messages when the emperor needs a messenger hardier than a Open Game License",

Most fane spirits were formerly clerics, though druids, paladins, and even lay worshippers can become fane spirits under the right circumstances. Fane spirits are lawful and typically only attack those who discover their undead nature or who try to harm their place of worship.  \n**Welcoming Priests.** During daylight hours, fane spirits appear to be living creatures, carrying on the same tasks they did when they were alive. Normal methods for detecting undead creatures do not work on them, and, unless attacked or injured, they show no outward signs of their true nature. This deception extends to the fane spirit itself, as it does not have any recollection of dying or of its time in its undead form. When this deception is revealed, the fane spirit becomes enraged with suffering and lashes out at those who made it remember.  \n**Undead Nature.** The fane spirit doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Their most unsettling aspect\u2014the constant spewing of plant material\u2014is due to a strange regenerative factor. The trees spontaneously generate plant material, which negatively interacts with their acidic interiors and causes them near-constant digestive discomfort. The fleshdregs can direct this acidified material as a spew, which temporarily suspends this continual production, but they are hesitant to do so except in extreme circumstances. If they lose too much acid or their acid somehow becomes neutralized, the pulpy material fills their innards, bloating them and eventually erupting through their skin.  \n**Friendly Trees.** Many intelligent creatures encountering fleshdregs judge them by their horrifying features, but the fleshdregs are amiable hosts. They understand that many creatures find them repulsive and react to hostility with calming words and a show of peace. Assuming they establish a friendly footing with visitors, they prove to be valuable sources of information about the surrounding territory. In some cases, fleshdregs volunteer to accompany their new acquaintances within a swamp, especially if the fleshdregs seek to relocate.  \n**Otherworldly Origins.** Scholars who have studied the strange trees conclude they derive from some foreign environment. They are split on whether the creatures come from beyond the stars or migrated from deep within the underworld.

Only the largest white dragons surpass the graknork in size and strength, and lesser creatures give the monster a wide berth. Graknorks are mostly found on land but are reasonable swimmers. They have no problem taking to the water to pursue escaping prey or to hunt fishermen and even whales. Graknorks are solitary creatures and cannot stand the presence of their own kind, attacking and eating juvenile graknorks that cross their path. When they do mate, it is a destructive affair with the female uprooting dozens of trees to build her nest. A typical graknork is more than forty feet long, though even larger specimens have been sighted in the coldest regions of the world.  \n**Great Blue Eye.** While the graknork\u2019s raw physical prowess is justifiably feared, the aspect of its appearance that causes the greatest consternation is its great, freezing blue eye. Its eye is said to possess terrible and wondrous powers, including seeing through illusions, freezing souls outright, and causing everlasting blizzards.

When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.  \n**Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.  \n**Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna\u2019s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways. The lunarchidna\u2019s statistics change cyclically as shown on the Lunarchidna Moon Phase table.  \n\n#### Lunarchidna Moon Phase\n\nMoon Phase\n\nStatistics\n\nDaytime, new, or crescent moon\n\nOpen Game License",

Able to differentiate between objects of value and worthless junk, the swarm stalks streets and sewers alike. Its movements are erratic; the cloud swells and contracts in quick succession, repositioning itself in jerky, stilted bursts of motion.//  \n**Bad Penny.** The swarm consists of normal, mundane valuables animated by a magical master coin. Often mistaken as a standard regional coin, this master coin is created in a dark ritual to serve as a vessel for pure, ceaseless avarice. If the master coin is destroyed or separated from the swarm, the remaining coins return to their normal inert state and fall to the ground.  \n**All that Glitters.** The master coin cannot exert its power without a large enough supply of valuables to control in close proximity. Bank and vault owners who fail to screen incoming coinage for latent magical properties may find themselves in need of adventurers to discreetly quell a storm of their accumulated wealth. Wishing wells and public fountains are also common homes for greed swarms.  \n**Construct Nature.** The greed swarm doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Resembling towering mirrors covered in tentacles and eyes, helashruu defy rational explanation. When they deem it necessary to communicate with other creatures, it is usually through a jumbled mishmash of thoughts with their telepathy, though making sense of what they say is often next to impossible.  \n**Trapping Gone Astray.** Sages versed in planar lore believe the helashruu were created when a mirror of life trapping swallowed a powerful, deity of chaos and shattered under the strain of the energies it tried to contain. The pieces then scattered across the planes before forming into the first helashruu. The helashruu sometimes trap creatures within themselves, giving credence to this belief. Some sages hypothesize that if all the helashruu were to gather together in one place, they would reform the original mirror, and the evil entity would be released from its confinement. Thankfully, these creatures are extremely rare and hold nothing but contempt for others of their own kind.",

When the week is over, the hodags disperse, returning to their territories.  \n**Impossible to Train.** Hodags are born with strong predator instincts, which helps the young survive after being left by their mothers. Many believe this same instinct makes hodags impossible to train, but such claims only make them more valuable targets for those who collect exotic pets.",

They attempted to bring the kelp forests near their settlement to life to entangle attackers, slowing them long enough to allow the merfolk to repel them. Instead, the first kelp eels were born as the blades of kelp wove themselves into massive eely forms that ravaged the very community they were created to protect.  \n**Serpents of the Shallows.** Since their creation, kelp eels have spread across the ocean. Forests of sentient kelp grow in ocean shallows, scarcely different to the casual observer from any other marine jungle. As the kelp matures, the blades wind around the thallus and eventually detach from its holdfast as a full-grown kelp eel. The kelp eel then moves on to an unclaimed shallow and attempts to create a new forest.  \n**Mariners\u2019 Nightmares.** The presence of a kelp eel is a blight upon people whose livelihoods depend on the ocean. The voracious eels are known to overturn boats and to drag their occupants to a watery grave. Kelp-entwined humanoid remains are common on the floor of kelp eel forests. Experienced sailors sometimes chum the waters as they approach a kelp forest, hoping to attract other large ocean predators to distract the local kelp eels.  \n**Deep Hunters.** While kelp eels live and breed in shallower waters, it isn\u2019t uncommon for them to hunt the ocean deeps if fertilizer is proving scarce near their forest. Knowledgeable mariners know that the presence of dead whales, sharks, and giant squid in shallow waters could be an indicator of kelp eel activity.",

Aside from meat, they enjoy fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Keyhole dragonettes with easy access to sugary foods often develop a sweet tooth.  \n**Loyal Companions.** Guards, wilderness scouts, and rogues of all types often see the value in taking a keyhole dragonette as a companion. Young dragonettes are easy to train and eagerly bond with people, quickly becoming steadfast friends with their caretakers.

It then waits patiently for its prey to draw near\u2014before striking out at them with its lightning-fast bite.  \n**Symbiotic Relationship.** The mist that covers a kirikari\u2019s body comes from a unique type of mold that adheres to its carapace. The mold secretes an acid that evaporates harmlessly shortly after being exposed to air. The kirikari uses this mist to conceal itself and disorient its prey. Despite being natural-born swimmers, kirikari tend to avoid swimming in ocean waters, as exposure to salt quickly kills its mold.  \n**Wyvern Hunters.** Though unusual for its behavior, kirikari have been known to travel incredible distances to hunt down wyverns. Some scholars theorize that the toxins within a wyvern\u2019s body are a necessary component in the maintenance of a kirikari\u2019s mold.",

All the while, a harrowing tune plays from the column of pipes rising from its core._  \nMad pipers are the heralds of the Great Old Ones, a sign that a cult is getting close to achieving their goals. Cultists receive visions from their masters, filling their dreams with the esoteric rituals needed to create a mad piper. In short order, the cult gathers the components and creates these creatures, typically one for each cell of the cult. When the time comes for the cult to do battle, the mad pipers follow, inspiring the faithful with the alien songs of the Great Old Ones.  \n**The Ritual.** During the ritual, five humanoids, one of which must be a musician of some kind, are tied to a set of bagpipes made from an ogre\u2019s bones and stomach. The ritual liquefies the humanoids, who fall into each other as all but their limbs and heads dissolve into a mass of grey flesh. Their minds, souls, and bodies forcefully merged, they start to play.  \n**Pets and Mascots.** Mad pipers aren\u2019t naturally evil. Most are made from commoners, resulting in relatively docile and loyal creatures that imprint quickly onto cult members, who in turn often come to treat these abominations as pets. More violent and powerful mad pipers can be made from powerful, evil humanoids, though they are harder to control and often hostile to their creators.  \n**True Pipers.** Scholars speculate that the mad pipers are modelled after the heralds of the Crawling Chaos, and that it was he who gifted the first ritual to mortals on behalf of all Great Old Ones.  \n**Construct Nature.** The mad piper doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

The power lingers in the grotesque mass of flesh, warping the creature\u2019s mind even more than its body and creating a hunter that hungers to consume and grow.

Malleables have infinite patience and can wait centuries until they feel the time is right to go on a psychic energy binge.  \n**Many Shapes.** Malleables have no set form, but they can stretch and alter their forms easily, moving on appendages or flowing like an ooze. They might form a face (or many faces at once) if they wish to convey an emotion to another creature, or take the shape of a truly terrifying beast (like a giant spider) if they wish to create panic. No matter the shape they take, malleables always appear to be a fleshy creature turned inside out.  \n**Our Powers Combined.** Malleables can join together, creating a larger, more powerful creature that shares the intellect of all the combined intelligences. These bigger malleables can separate into smaller aberrations when it suits them.  \n**Ancient Knowledge Hoarders.** It is said that malleables have perfect memories and the oldest of these creatures remember ancient lore other creatures have long forgotten.

The raising of a settlement in a mountain nymph\u2019s territory will attract her immediate attention.

They have been known to track their prey far from their native mountains, across continents and into mortal cities. When a nymph catches up to her mark, she harries it without mercy or remorse. A nymph\u2019s mark, assuming it has done nothing to offend or harm the nymph, can throw the nymph off its tail by exiting her territory and leaving tribute of freshly hunted meat and strong drink.",

They live among the peaks, climbing seemingly impossible slopes to make their homes in the caves and burrows they dig near the tops. Ages ago, they had amicable relations with nearby settlements, but their aggressive behavior and boorish attitudes led to conflicts with the populace. They were subsequently made to withdraw from civilization as a result. In the years since, they have become an insular people, fearful of outsiders and resentful of civilization.  \n**Communal.** Mountain striders live in communal groups that travel the mountains, moving with the seasons. They are highly protective of each other and go into a brief rage when one of their number falls. Their nomadic and overly protective natures occasionally bring them into conflict with dwarves, though the two don\u2019t actively hunt each other.  \n**Bleating Communication.** The weather on the highest mountain peaks can turn at a moment\u2019s notice, separating family groups within minutes. The mountain striders adapted to such dangers by developing complex bleating calls. Over time, these calls became part of the mountain striders\u2019 culture, seeing use outside of emergency situations. The calls range from simple notifications of an individual\u2019s location or health to short songs identifying family affiliation and lineage.",

Their cruelty and preference for intelligent prey both lend credence to the notion that the Abyssa has influenced their mutations.  \n**Afraid of Herons.** The only known way to deter a murgrik from attacking is to introduce a heron, real or illusory.

If dispatched to kill someone, a naizu-ha can be coerced to switch sides with a promise that their new task will involve more violence than the current job does. They have no patience for subtle work or trickery that involves more than a quick feint. A favorite tactic of naizu-ha is to fulfill a contract, collect whatever payment has been agreed upon, and immediately murder the initial contractor.  \n**Bloody Biers.** To summon a naizu-ha, the blood of no fewer than three humanoids must be splashed on a stand forged of fused blades. If the petitioner uses their own blood in the ceremony, they have advantage on any ability checks they make to treat with the naizu-ha.  \n**Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn\u2019t require food, drink, or sleep.",

The lair of the rare ogrepede that has slipped its master\u2019s bonds is full of its debased treasures and, in some instances, the mutilated but still-living victims of their assaults.  \n**Noisy Wanderers.** People are rarely surprised by the arrival of an ogrepede. Unless specifically commanded not to by their creator, ogrepedes emit a constant haunting moan, as though the creature laments all it has lost. Even if told to be silent, ogrepedes are not quiet. Their fat fingers drum noisily at the ground and their bodies slam gracelessly into corridor walls as they careen along on their duties.  \n**Poor Allies.** Ogrepedes have difficulty getting along with other creatures, including other ogrepedes. Vestiges of the craven instincts the ogres possessed in life remain after death, causing the ogrepede to lash out at any creature near it, particularly if the target is already wounded. Even when commanded to work with other creatures by their masters, it is merely a matter of when, not if, an ogrepede will attack its companions; the betrayal is inevitable.  \n**Undead Nature.** An ogrepede doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

    "desc": "Brown fur covers the entire surface of this humanoid, which also has the black nose and small ears of an otter. Its piecemeal leather armor and weapon at the ready give the impression it is prepared for a fight._  \n**Foe to Reptilians.** While generally peaceful creatures, otterfolk bear an enmity for reptilians, owing to their near extinction in the jaws of giant alligators and other large swamp predators. They are wary of intelligent reptilian creatures, such as lizardfolk and naga, who regularly prey on their people. Otterfolk pass this animosity on to future generations through tales of heroic otterfolk overcoming ferocious snakes and mighty alligators. From the time an otterfolk kit can walk, it learns how to wield the atlatl and to be mindful of the presence of their hated foes. Otterfolk are wary of reptilian visitors or those accompanied by reptiles, but they are cordial to all others.  \n**Swamp Guides.** Otterfolk are excellent sources of information about the territory surrounding their homes, and they often escort friendly visitors through the swamp. The price for this service depends on the combat capabilities of those they escort. Their overwhelming martial outlook causes them to value visitors who can prove themselves in combat. If a group seems capable of protecting itself, the otterfolk reason they don\u2019t have to defend the group in addition to guiding it. They often ask such groups for a pittance in rations or monetary value (preferring pearls to other valuable items). Otterfolk greatly increase their fees for groups apparently incapable of fighting off potential swamp hazards. However, they pride themselves on never abandoning their charges.  \n**Otter Trainers.** Otterfolk often raise river otters as guard animals and pets, which serve the same function in their society as dogs in human societies. Otterfolk regard the animals warmly and become sad when favored pets die. They rarely allow their otters to engage in combat. They regularly hold contests where otter owners show off their training prowess by directing their otters in feats of strength, cunning, and dexterity. These contests never involve pitting the otters against each other in combat. The rare few otterfolk who choose to become wizards take otters as familiars. Otterfolk rangers often raise larger river otter specimens (use the statistics of a Open Game License",

Though not especially picky in their choice of victims, they are empathetically drawn to creatures experiencing some form of despair or pain.  \n**Emotionless Killers.** Quoreqs do not experience emotions the same way most humanoids do and have no concept of fear or love. They do not inflict pain for simple enjoyment, instead inflicting it to share in the experience such intense emotions can produce. As they inflict pain, they often telepathically ask their victims how it feels.  \n**Horrible Feeding.** Quoreqs eat and sleep like any normal creature, but, since their mouths are concealed beneath their rigid flesh, they must use their claws to rip open their own bodies to quickly gulp down food before they can regenerate. This unusual and horrific practice lends some support to the theory that quoreqs are wholly unnatural creatures born directly from human nightmares.",

This instability might be caused by a regional anomaly, war between the gods themselves, magical upheaval, or some other calamity. Thousands of radiant sparks are created at once in massive conflagrations of radiant energy. They are then left to wander the planes alone. These creatures are most often found in the border lands between planes, but they have been known to appear in the Material Plane after accessing it through magical portals. They seldom wander back to their planes of origin and are almost always destroyed at some point during their eternal wanderings.  \n**Hunger for Magic.** Radiant spark swarms are drawn to magic for reasons that aren\u2019t fully understood, for they can neither use it, nor do they truly devour it. Instead, when they sense powerful magic nearby, they instinctually move toward it, as though its very presence is comforting to them. As creatures that are neither particularly intelligent nor evil, their interest in the living usually has to do with the magic spellcasters carry, which draws the sparks close. Unfortunately, the owner of the magic that drew them is often caught in the midst of the swarm, which is inherently harmful.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A radiant spark swarm doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

That inventor\u2019s identity is one of the many secrets the first repository faithfully keeps. These constructs are built for the reception, transmission, and safeguarding of information, and even those that don\u2019t hold particularly coveted information still defend their charges with lethal force. Repositories sometimes hold secrets within their consciousness, a task made easier by the fact that these creatures can understand all languages. Others hold physical recordings of information within their chest cavities.  \n**Master of Language.** A repository exists to protect and trade information, and as such, it knows and can translate all languages. Its programming allows it to wield this mastery of language as a physical weapon. A repository can also use the power of language as a psychic assault, uttering words of power to attack the very minds of its enemies.  \n**Right Tool for the Job.** The chest cavity of a repository contains an extradimensional space that functions like a bag of holding, granting the repository the ability to pull out any tool that may be required. Most repositories keep sets of common tools stashed inside their chests, including thieves\u2019 tools and smith\u2019s tools. Some repositories, however, are equipped with specialized tools or magic items, depending on the creatures\u2019 purpose at creation. Similarly, a repository can store anything it needs to protect in this extra-dimensional space. The repository is the only creature capable of retrieving items from this space while it is alive. When a repository is destroyed, its chest cavity becomes accessible to anyone that reaches inside its pyramidal form; however, the power holding this extra-dimensional space together fades after 1 hour. An object in the extra-dimensional space when it fades is destroyed. A creature in the extra-dimensional space when it fades is deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.  \n**Construct Nature.** A repository doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

A puff of steam rises from the rock, and the creature licks at the liquid remains, leaving a pockmark in the stone._  \n**Rock Eaters.** The rock roach is a giant cousin to the roach, and it feeds on rocks deep beneath the ground. It uses its proboscis to deposit acidic saliva onto the rock, breaking it down and lapping up the liquefied minerals. A rock roach\u2019s metabolism is slow to match its tedious eating process. Even still, a group of rock roaches can make quick work of a rocky wall, opening up routes between caverns. The roaches aren\u2019t concerned for structural integrity and their eating habits, if left unimpeded, often lead to cave-ins.  \n**Naturally Hostile.** Rock roaches are instinctually hostile to anything that wanders near them, including each other. The roaches mate annually, and the parents abandon the eggs shortly after laying them. Young rock roaches band together for the first few months of life, protecting each other as they devour the rock where they hatched, then dispersing once they are large enough to defend themselves.  \n**Valuable Carapace.** The carapace of a rock roach is sought after by some groups of underground humanoids. Naturally resilient and hard, craftsman harvest the carapace and slowly sculpt it into a suit of armor in a month-long process that requires regular boiling of the tough carapace.",

They are bipedal primates that stand about nine feet tall and are covered in black, brown, or red fur.  \n**Famously Elusive.** Many people claim to have seen a sasquatch, but almost none have proof of their interaction with the beast, creating questions about the creature\u2019s existence. Skeptics claim sasquatch sightings are simply misidentified bears, apes, or similar creatures. Many sages and hunters journey deep into forests, hoping to find proof sasquatches exist and returning only with a handful of fur that could belong to almost any animal. In truth sasquatches are solitary nocturnal creatures that generally avoid confrontation. They prefer to stay in the shadows of the forest, dining on vegetation and insects while staying clear of other creatures.  \n**Hidden Lairs.** Sasquatches are smart enough to hide the entrances to their lairs with heavy boulders, underbrush, fallen trees, a waterfall, or some other obstruction that appears to be a natural part of the terrain. They hide gathered food and shiny trinkets they find in the forest in these cozy homes, where they rest during daylight hours.  \n**Aggressive When Provoked.** Though sasquatches prefer to avoid confrontation, they fight savagely when cornered or if another creature threatens their home or food source. Their powerful fists and teeth make formidable weapons. Sasquatches do not hesitate to initiate a conflict when threatened.  \n**Attracted and Soothed by Music.** There are some who claim sasquatches are drawn and calmed by music, particularly songs with a lullaby-like quality. These tales come with a warning: stopping the song before the sasquatch is lulled to sleep by its melody causes the beast to go into a violent rage.",

Those who know about scarlet ibises and their terrible curses avoid killing the birds and typically warn others about the consequences of killing them. Less scrupulous folk instead encourage na\u00efve travelers to destroy a scarlet ibis then pick off the travelers suffering from the aftereffects of combat with the birds.  \n**Dream Portent.** The scarlet ibis is a symbol of ill omens that appears in dreams. This omen precedes a setback\u2014such as inclement weather, a tremor, the group getting lost, or a lame mount or pack animal\u2014but it can also indicate a doomed mission. After a series of unfortunate incidents, the scarlet ibis makes a physical appearance, signifying the bad luck has ended. This sometimes incites the unfortunates to avenge themselves on the bird under the mistaken belief the ibis is the cause of the problems.  \n**Egret Harpy Friends.** Scarlet ibises congregate with Open Game License",

Their translucent skin and internal organs allow them to blend in with water and against icy backgrounds. Against other backgrounds, they leave a telltale shimmer, giving them their name. However, the seals can still take the unwary by surprise in less-than-ideal conditions. The only time the seal fully loses it translucency is when it consumes its diet of fish or small mammals, during which observers receive a breathtaking (or nauseating) view of the seals\u2019 digestive process. The seals are aware of this vulnerability and usually feast in hidden locations. Arctic druids and rangers who successfully befriend shimmer seals use them as spies or as an advance wave of attack.  \n**Guardian of Seals.** Though shimmer seals notionally look like harbor seals, they are found among many different species of seal. Scholars who have studied the strange seals concluded shimmer seals are created when the spirits of creatures passionate about protecting overhunted animals merge with those of ordinary seals. When a shimmer seal dies protecting a pod of seals from hunters, one of the seals transforms into a new shimmer seal within a minute of the other shimmer seal\u2019s death, reinforcing this theory. While shimmer seals are vigilant against hunting by humanoids, they allow natural predators to cull the seals under their protection, understanding the natural order and its importance.  \n**Rallying Seal.** A shimmer seal allows other seals to see it, and it can allow allied creatures to locate it. The presence of a shimmer seal emboldens the seals under its protection, transforming a pod of seals that might scatter in the face of armed opposition into an army of teeth and flippers, with the shimmer seal leading the counterattack. No one knows if the shimmer seal is aware of its ability to reincarnate shortly after it dies, but its fearlessness points to it possessing a certainty of survival.",

The air near its mouth, large enough to carry a horse, visibly vibrates with sound pulses._  \nShriekbats thrive in the cavernous spaces of the Underworld where they face little competition from dragons, rocs, and other large flying creatures, as they would aboveground. Despite their enormousness, the bats deftly maneuver among the stalactites and stalagmites crowding underground caverns. When they attack prey, or in the very rare cases where they must escape predators, they emit a terrible shriek that overwhelms their foes and allows them to easily grab prey or escape. Shriekbat echolocation uses subsonic frequencies, allowing the bats to fly in relative silence.  \n**Kobold Companions.** Kobold bat keepers know the secret to raising young shriekbats. The bat keepers often risk their lives to procure young, using the bats for protection and as companions. A bat keeper returns its shriekbat to the wild before the bat reaches adulthood, when it would become too large for the cramped kobold tunnels. A bat keeper tracks the shriekbats it releases, and often returns to visit its former companions. Shriekbats prove surprisingly keen at remembering former kobold handlers (whether such handlers treated them well or poorly), and they often allow fondly remembered handlers to take a single pup from their litters, ensuring the pup survives to adulthood and renewing the cycle.  \n**Long-Lived Omnivores.** Shriekbats live for nearly 50 years. They are social and promiscuous creatures that live in small groups in large caverns. They are omnivorous but prefer fresh meat to other food with lizards taking up the majority of their diet. Shriekbats can survive on rotten flesh, which allows them to eat ghouls and other undead populating the Underworld, but they find it less palatable. In overcrowded situations where multiple groups of shriekbats roost in the same cavern, a group of shriekbats might break away to find another hunting location if food becomes scarce.",

Shukankors are neither female nor male and reproduce by allowing their replicas to remain alive. After a day, these replicas become free-thinking and separate from the parent shukankor. A month later, they grow into full-sized shukankors with all the powers of their progenitor.",

It inflicts a victim with a deadly bout of laughter that causes its internal organs to rupture and fail. After the victim dies, the shurale cuts it into pieces, leaving the remains for the scavengers.  \n**Feeds on Laughter.** A shurale feeds on the sobbing laughs of its victims as they expire, its own health mysteriously revitalized in the process. Because of this, shurale lairs are typically located within a few miles of a humanoid settlement, where it can easily lure lone inhabitants into the woods. While most of their prey are humanoids living in alpine or heavily forested regions, shurales are not picky and have been known to attack orcs, ogres, trolls, and even hill giants.  \n**Woodcutter\u2019s Curse.** Many believe that a shurale is the spirit of a woodcutter who died a lonely and embittered death after being ridiculed by family. While such an occurrence would be exceedingly rare and most sages scoff at such suggestions, the shurale\u2019s skill with the woodcutter\u2019s axe and its strange behavior cannot be denied.",

The presence of a silenal is usually discovered slowly by the owner. Perhaps they notice the bar towels have all been mended or that the empty bottles have been placed outside the back door. If the owner accepts this assistance and leaves small gifts of food and drink, the silenal becomes more active. After hours, the silenal spends its time ensuring the establishment is cleaned to a shine and ready for the next day\u2019s business. If the owner and the silenal are at odds, however, the small mischiefs and mishaps caused by the silenal quickly drive the owner out of business.  \n**Flawed Advisors.** While the business is open, a silenal spends most of its time drinking and conversing with the patrons. Sileni are curious about mortals and find their tales and troubles fascinating. If a creature conversing with a silenal asks it for advice, the counsel received is invariably flawed. The silenal, interested in hearing more dramatic tales, offers guidance which is guaranteed to get its conversation partner in hot water in the hopes the recipient will return to lament new, entertaining troubles.  \n**Calm in the Storm.** Regardless of how chaotic activity gets in its bar, the silenal is strangely unaffected. Tavern brawls, whether caused by the silenal or not, never target it. The damage caused by fights is also reduced and rarely results in more than a few broken chairs and tankards.",

Closer inspection reveals the smile is disturbingly jagged._  \n**Demonic Snow People.** Snow terrors hail from an icy layer of the Abyss. There, they torment lesser fiends or watch as wind-whipped snow destroys visitors wholly unprepared for it. Such visitors are few and far between, leading snow terrors to travel to the Material Plane for greater chances at entertainment.  \n**Innocuous Disguise.** Snow terrors temper their desire for bloodshed and mayhem with patience. They find heavily trafficked areas and lurk nearby, observing potential prey. When choosing victims, they remain motionless in their guise as ordinary snowpersons, even allowing children to pluck the accoutrements off them.  \n**Sadistic Hunter.** A snow terror picks off lone people first, reveling in communities consequently thrown into chaos. Just before it attacks, it reveals its true form: a leering, shark-toothed snowperson with unholy light glowing in its eye sockets. It chases, catches, and devours its victims, relishing the screams as the acid churning in its guts slowly dissolves its prey. It can take on the appearance of its victims, drawing in concerned family members and neighbors before dissolving the facade to attack.",

Once exposed to the open air, the chemicals become highly corrosive and toxic.  \n**Wandering Mushroom.** Unlike many fungi, the strobing fungus is able to move, albeit at a slow pace. It does this by severing the portion of its base anchoring it in place and secreting some of the chemicals within its body to help it glide along to a new location. When it has reached its intended destination, it stops secreting the chemical, its movement stops, and the creature quickly attaches to the ground at the new location.  \n**Popular Guards.** Strobing fungi are often employed as guardians, particularly by creatures that have blindsight.

They surround their victims\u2019 heads and extract these gases, usually in copious quantities as their victims panic and breathe harder. This leads many to believe the bubbles are sadistic. However, encounters with swampgas bubbles are rarely fatal, since the bubbles typically sate themselves by the time their prey falls unconscious, losing interest as the creature\u2019s breathing slows.  \n**Attracted to Fire.** A swampgas bubble is instinctively drawn to fire, even though they are highly flammable. Its susceptibility to fire makes it relatively easy to dispatch, but its explosive ending makes the use of fire risky for its foes. In fact, this form of death, accompanied by a beautiful burst of blue light, is just part of the bubble\u2019s overall lifecycle. Its outer layer hardens and shatters, and the remaining bits fall into the swamp where they grow and encase swamp gasses, developing into new swampgas bubbles.  \n**Ooze Nature.** A swampgas bubble doesn\u2019t require sleep.",

They can twist their limbs into unnatural positions and even bend completely double. The flexibility and elasticity help the giants shrug off crushing blows. They can stay in contorted positions for extraordinary lengths of time and use this to their advantage to ambush unsuspecting creatures.",

When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.  \n**Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.  \n**Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna\u2019s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways. The lunarchidna\u2019s statistics change cyclically as shown on the Lunarchidna Moon Phase table.  \n\n#### Lunarchidna Moon Phase\n\nMoon Phase\n\nStatistics\n\nDaytime, new, or crescent moon\n\nOpen Game License",

Attracted to anything that glitters, jangles, or just plain smells nice, the valkruung steals anything regardless of its actual worth.

They steal objects they don\u2019t need and refuse to return them, running off while snickering wildly.  \n**Shrines of Riches.** Anything a valkruung steals and doesn\u2019t eat is placed in a central location in its nest, often around an existing statue, altar, or other large object. Eventually, this object becomes covered in a variety of clutter, some of which may be valuable. A valkruung treats all of its objects equally and attacks anyone who tries to take something from the pile.  \n**Den of Thieves.** Valkruungs are social creatures and live in groups of ten to twenty. The job of child-rearing is shared by all members of the group equally, and young valkruungs spend the first parts of their lives carried around on various adults\u2019 backs, where the adults\u2019 tendrils keep them safe.

    "desc": "The beautiful singer bows to the adoring crowd before stepping behind the curtain. Away from the eyes of the crowd, the singer changes its half-mask, briefly revealing a ghastly, undead visage._  \nA virtuoso lich is an artist whose love of art sustains it beyond death.  \n**Birthed by Art.** A virtuoso lich is created when an artist powerful in both its artistic and magical expression dies with art left undone. Such artists often die before completing or creating a masterpiece, and the torment of the art left undone couples with the artist\u2019s powerful magical talents, turning the artist into a virtuoso lich. A virtuoso lich is bound to an object of art, such as a favorite musical instrument, painting, dance slippers, quill, or some other object of artistic expression that was significant to the lich in life. This piece of art is the lich\u2019s phylactery.  \n**Beautiful Mien.** A virtuoso lich maintains the beauty of its former life, appearing much as it did in life\u2014save for one physical feature that betrays its undead nature. This undead feature can be a clawed, skeletal hand, which the lich hides in a glove; a stiff, zombie-like leg, which the lich disguises with robes and a cane; a face ravaged by undeath, which the lich covers in a beautiful mask; or any other appropriate feature.  \n**Undead Nature.** The virtuoso lich doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.  \n\n## A Virtuoso Lich\u2019s Lair\n\n  \nA virtuoso lich chooses a lair with an eye and ear for artistic potential, whether that lair is an ancient cavern with natural acoustics, a meadow with plentiful natural light, a hall of mirrors, or some other locale capable of enhancing some form of art, allowing the lich\u2019s magic and artistic expression to swell, reaching every corner.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the virtuoso lich takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the lich can\u2019t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The virtuoso lich channels artistic expression it can see or hear into a magical assault. The artistic expression must be of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait, but it otherwise can be any form of expression not originating from the lich, such as the song of nearby singers that echoes in the lair, the colorful paint decorating canvases, the twirling forms of dancers, or similar. The virtuoso lich chooses a creature it can see within 30 feet of the artistic expression. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) damage of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n* The virtuoso lich enhances the natural artistry of its lair, distracting and hindering nearby creatures. The lich chooses a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws against the lich\u2019s spells and its Corrupted Art action until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n* The virtuoso lich rolls a d4 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.",

It has three forward-facing, segmented eyes and a protruding, bloodstained proboscis._  \n**Unknown Origins.** The origins of the wardu are unknown, though scholars speculate that they came from the Plateau of Leng. It is said they were introduced to the Material Plane as a result of an ill-fated expedition by a group of wizards to the edges of the multiverse. The wizards were attacked by a horde of wardu who followed them through the planar rift they created to return home. Although the rift was sealed immediately, dozens of the wardu were trapped on the Material Plane and have since reproduced for numerous generations.  \n**Blood Drinkers.** Wardu are blood drinkers, and it is the only way they absorb sustenance. They are able to attack and gain sustenance from any creature that has blood, no matter the type. Their hunger drives them to attack most creatures they encounter, though they are smart enough to discern the difference between a potential food source and a more powerful creature not worth provoking.  \n**Magic Hunters.** Wardus have a thirst for the blood of spellcasters and even put themselves at risk to obtain that tastiest of treats. Drinking arcane-infused blood has imbued the wardu with some magical power. It can channel this power through its central eye, but the segmented nature of its eye causes the magic to become unstable and scatter as it passes through the eye\u2019s facets.",

When they are alone, they spend much of their time traversing the territory surrounding their homes, watchful for creatures in dire straits or in need of shelter. Wintergrims offer assistance and lodging to travelers they encounter and jump to the rescue for those in immediate peril. They readily share the furs in which they bundle themselves and are often laden with warm soups and beverages they share with visitors suffering from the elements.  \n**Inscrutable Rules.** A wintergrim\u2019s hospitality has limits, as each wintergrim has a unique set of behaviors it holds taboo within the confines of its home. Breaking its rules is so abhorrent to a wintergrim, it dares not even discuss the things it forbids. The rules range from the seemingly innocuous\u2014such as leaving one\u2019s boots on when entering a wintergrim\u2019s home\u2014to common societal norms\u2014such as not attacking or killing another guest. Discovering a wintergrim\u2019s proscribed behavior is difficult, since the wintergrim ignores transgressions outside its home, perhaps giving a cryptic warning that it wouldn\u2019t tolerate the same in its domicile. Mere discussion about its rules may also provoke the fey.  \nWhatever the case, wintergrims demand rulebreakers leave their premises at once, resorting to pummeling those who fail to comply.  \n**Competent Woodsfolk.** As loners with occasional guests, wintergrims are necessarily self-sustaining. They are omnivorous, and they grow gardens, set traps, and hunt for their food. Though they are inured to cold temperatures, they enjoy having a house in which they can reside and share their hospitality. They are adept with the axes they wield to chop down trees for their homes and fires, but they are careful not to overharvest wood. Other than when they hunt, they rarely use their axes as weapons. They prefer to punch their opponents in the hope they can drive their foes away, resorting to their axes only in desperate situations.",

Wood wards aren\u2019t awakened lightly, however, as the villagers rarely possess the rituals to return the wards to their slumber.  \n**Implements of Terror.** Unknown to most villages that possess them, wood wards were originally created by evil druids to sow terror in logging villages that were encroaching on the forest. The druids circulated wards around these villages, spreading rumors of their protective capabilities. Most of the druids succumbed to age, heroes, or other forces before getting the chance to enact their schemes, and the villages continued on with wards that did exactly as rumored. Some druid circles still possess the knowledge for awakening the true nature of the wood wards, and stories have surfaced of villages in the darkest depths of the forest going silent, possessing nothing but empty houses and a wall of silent wood wards.  \n**Construct Nature.** A wood ward doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food.

Humanoid in appearance, they possess skin tones that range from pale silver to dark gray. Intrinsically tied to the dream world, they can use sleeping creatures as both weapons and transportation.  \n**Alien Minds.** Although yumerai spend most of their time in the waking world, they have difficulty remembering the differences between dreams and reality. This leads some to misunderstand basic laws of physics or to believe dreams events were real events.  \n**Dream Walkers.** A yumerai can enter an individual\u2019s dreams and use those dreams as a means of transportation to another\u2019s dreams. This process brief connects the creatures, though the yumerai tries not to make its presence known. When multiple people have the same dream, they may have had a yumerai pass through their sleeping minds.  \n**The Gift of Sleep.** For a yumerai, sleep serves as both a tool and a gift. As creatures unable to sleep or dream, the yumerai consider the ability to dream a gift that all mortals should appreciate. As they travel through mortal dreams, yumerai collect energy from the dreams and use it as a form of currency in fey realms. Fey use dream energy in much the same way mortals use paint, creating seemingly alive portraits or making illusions look, smell, sound, or taste more real.  \n**The Horror of Nightmares.** Yumerai usually look forward to the opportunity to experience new dreams. However, not all dreams are pleasant. Particularly horrifying nightmares may leave permanent mental scars on yumerai who witness them, changing them forever. These yumerai take on a sinister and sometimes sadistic personality, seeking to inflict the pain they felt through the nightmare on those around them.  \n**Dream Walker.** A yumerai doesn\u2019t require sleep.",

The sand crackles with dark energy, and the creature\u2019s eyes burn with malign intelligence._  \nAn enormous vulture forged from sand and malignant power, a zalikum is created by mages who capture souls of the damned and infuse them into the superheated sands of the desert.  \n**Abyssal Ties.** The souls infusing a zalikum are from the Abyss. A zalikum\u2019s creator can gather these souls from the Abyss themselves, but, more often, the creator makes a deal with a demon in exchange for the souls. Unfortunately for the creator, the demon usually hands over souls that aren\u2019t the easiest to control, leading many creators to die at the talons of their zalikums. Such destruction frees the demon from its bonds, releasing it and the zalikum into the world.  \n**Innumerable Lives.** The souls infusing the sand of the zalikum can reform it after it has been destroyed. This process consumes some of the power of the souls, forcing the zalikum to devour more souls to fuel further rebirths.  \n**Construct Nature.** A zalikum doesn\u2019t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

If a moment of clarity pierces its madness, a zeitgeist might attempt a quick conversation or simply remain motionless, enjoying the temporary reprieve from its tortured existence.  \n**Still Living.** Though named \u201cghosts,\u201d zeitgeists aren\u2019t dead; rather, something mysterious about their situation sustains them. Similar to a ghost, a zeitgeist might be tied to a particular location, albeit at different points in time.
