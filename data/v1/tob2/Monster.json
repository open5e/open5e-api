Its limbs end in large, grasping claws that look strong enough to crush the life out of a bear._  \n**Hidden Terror.** The dreaded a-mi-kuk is a terrifying creature that feasts on any who venture into the bleak and icy expanses of the world. A-mi-kuks prowl the edges of isolated communities, snatching those careless enough to wander too far from camp. They also submerge themselves beneath frozen waters, coming up from below to grab and strangle lone fishermen.  \n**Fear of Flames.** A-mi-kuks have a deathly fear of fire, and anyone using fire against one has a good chance of making it flee in terror, even if the fire-user would otherwise be outmatched. A-mi-kuks are not completely at the mercy of this fear, however, and lash out with incredible fury if cornered by someone using fire against them.  \n**Unknown Origins.** A-mi-kuks are not natural creatures and contribute little to the ecosystems in which they live. The monsters are never seen together, and some believe them to be a single monster, an evil spirit made flesh that appears whenever a group of humans has angered the gods. A-mi-kuks have no known allies and viciously attack any creatures that threaten them, regardless of the foe’s size or power.",

While primarily a water-dwelling monster, the aalpamac can haul itself onto shore with its front claws and does so to attack prey drinking or moving at the water’s edge. While not evil, the aalpamac is a ravenous and territorial creature, ranging over an area of up to a dozen miles in search of fresh meat. Aalpamacs are not picky about what they consume and even attack large boats if sufficiently hungry. They are solitary creatures and tolerate others of their own kind only during mating seasons.  \n**Local Legends.** An aalpamac that terrorizes the same lake or river for many years often develops a reputation among the locals of the area, particularly those living along the body of water in question. Inevitably, this gives rise to a number of stories exaggerating the size, ferocity, disposition, or powers of the aalpamac. The stories often give aalpamacs names that highlight their most prominent features or are specific to the area in which they live, such as “Chompo” or “the Heron Lake Monster.” These stories also make the aalpamac the target of adventurers and trophy hunters, most of whom either do not locate the beast or fall victim to it.",

Many scholars turn to the giants’ deep connection with the earth as evidence of this fact, and the giants themselves make no efforts to deny it. Indeed, the oral tradition of the abbanith giants dates back millennia, to a time when gods walked the land, elves were first learning the secrets of magic, and humans were still living in caves. Most abbanith giants wear simple tunics or shorts woven of a strange subterranean fungus, though leaders occasionally wear armor.  \n**Consummate Diggers.** Abbanith giants dwell almost exclusively underground and are adept at using their incredibly hard thumb claws to dig massive tunnels through the earth. Druids and wizards studying the giants’ unique biology have deduced that mineral-based materials actually soften when struck by their claws. This feature has also made them the target of derro and duergar slavers wishing to use their skills to mine precious gems or build their fortifications, something the giants violently oppose despite their normally peaceable nature.  \n**Allies of the Earth.** For as long as either race can remember, abbanith giants have been allies of the Open Game License",

Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon’s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter.

Each akaasit is always found moving toward some unknown destination. It may attack other creatures, or it may ignore them. It protects itself if attacked, but rarely does an akaasit pursue a retreating foe.  \n**Unknown Origin.** The home of the akaasit is unknown, but they are often encountered in areas touched or altered by time magic. Although a few wizards have discovered magical methods of summoning them, none have found a way to control or communicate with them. Akaasits seem to be drawn to spellcasters with some mastery of time magic, though it is always a gamble if an individual akaasit will protect or ruthlessly attack such a spellcaster. An akaasit’s demeanor can change each day, and many time magic spellcasters have been found slain by the same akaasit that faithfully protected them the day prior.  \n**Dispersed Destruction.** If an akaasit is destroyed, it falls apart into a pile of gray triangles. These triangles fade out of existence over the next ten minutes, leaving only the akaasit’s two armblades.  \n**Construct Nature.** The akaasit doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Though they have been seen across all of the world’s oceans and many of its coastlines, akhluts are most comfortable in cold regions with easy access to the sea. Because their pods can reach almost a dozen members, anything is fair game from reindeer and seals to mammoths and whales. The only beings powerful enough, or foolhardy enough, to evict a pod of akhluts from their territory are dragons and other akhluts.  \n**Playful Predators.** Akhluts possess undeniable cunning and inquisitiveness, with no two pods using the same strategies to solve problems or hunt prey. Easily bored, akhluts crave stimulation and are known to follow ships and caravans for miles in the hopes that someone might provide something new or exciting to experience. They can be especially mischievous, freeing fish and game from traps purely to hunt he creatures themselves.  \n**Dangerous Steeds.** The akhlut’s natural power, intelligence, and versatility make them incredibly desirable mounts, but the effort to tame one of these creatures is dangerous and not to be taken lightly. Even akhluts who have been mounts for years are willful enough to assert themselves from time to time. With a great deal of patience and a little luck, akhluts can become fiercely loyal and protective companions.",

Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.  \n**Dragons of Rage.** Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon’s admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter.

They use local spiders as spies and informants to get closer to their quarries or discover dark secrets their quarries would rather keep hidden. Ever patient in their schemes of corruption, arachnocrats often court their quarries over months of theatre, dinner parties, and elaborate balls.  \n**Hidden in Plain Sight.** Arachnocrats are adept at disguising themselves as aristocrats. Their most noticeable features are their clawed hands and their spider-like faces, which they cover with gloves, masks, scarves, voluminous robes, and similar attire. The eccentricities of the well-to-do help to cast off any suspicion over their odd coverings.  \n**As Good As Gold.** The arachnocrat’s preferred prey comes at a high price. Blessed by the Arch-Devil of Greed, Mammon, arachnocrats have a second stomach that can turn common rocks into faux gemstones. The fiends vomit up the gemstones after digesting the rocks for a few months, and they use the gemstones to fund their endeavors. The counterfeit nature of the gems is detectable by only true craftsmen.",

There is wide variation among specimens of this hybrid, however, with different creators replacing portions of the creature depending on the material they have on hand during the creation process. Most august roosters are created entirely of avian material, though specimens evidencing snake necks, turtle shells, and stag bodies have been encountered. Once created, an august rooster can reproduce with any species of bird, which usually results in an exotic-looking example of the bird. Only three percent of eggs fertilized or laid by an august rooster hatch into another august rooster. An august rooster fused by magic is full grown at creation, while one that hatches naturally grows to adulthood over the span of six to eight months.  \n**Selfish and Self-serving.** August roosters display the basest instincts of their creators, and they have the mental faculties and temperament of a spoiled, malicious child. Their sole concern is their own comfort, and they use their natural gifts to force nearby humanoids to tend to their wants and needs. Young august roosters are brazen about their collections of servants, often working the servants to exhaustion with constant demands. More mature individuals have a strong sense of self-preservation and have their servants see to their needs only when they know it will not raise suspicion.",

As the world thawed, avalanche screamers fled to mountain peaks and polar regions to hunt smaller prey. Avalanche screamer lairs contain a jumble of bones from their victims but have no other commonalities.  \n**Devious Hunter.** A versatile predator, the avalanche screamer can attack its prey from the ground beneath or from cliffs and trees above. It prefers to pick off its victims one at a time, grabbing stragglers at the back of a group and killing them before returning to the group. When it must face multiple foes simultaneously, it uses its scream to inflict harm on as many targets as possible. In unstable areas, the sound can cause avalanches, which the avalanche screamer rides out unscathed. It then uses its ability to detect vibrations to locate survivors, tunnel its way toward them, and devour them.  \n**Summer Hibernation.** Because avalanche screamers become lethargic and vulnerable in warmer temperatures, they hide themselves during the brief summers in their mountaintop and polar habitats. In preparation for their summer slumbers, they aggressively hunt prey, fattening themselves or stockpiling in their lairs. As a precaution against hunters that might follow them to their lairs, avalanche screamers often collect their food from miles away and tunnel through the ground to leave no tracks. Those who manage to track the creatures and hope to easily dispatch them while they are sluggish find avalanche screamers quickly shake their torpor to defend themselves.",

They crave the adulation of their peers, the attention of strangers, the promise of fame and the immortality it brings. Unfortunately, not every such artist has the talent and perseverance to succeed. Whenever a minstrel flees a stage pelted by rotting produce and ends their life in despair, or an actor’s alcoholism leads them to an early grave after a scathing review, a bleakheart is born. Once a bleakheart rises, it seeks to spread hopelessness and create new bleakhearts.  \n**Walking Shadows.** Bleakhearts exist on the fringes of the societies where they once lived. When they are not skulking in the dark, the citizenry ignores them as they would any other drifter. They linger around taverns, theaters, and other places the living visit for entertainment. Sometimes the sight and sound of merriment rouses the bleakhearts from cold despair to hot rage. The resulting carnage invariably leads to the destruction of the originating bleakheart and the creation of several new ones.  \n**Familiar Faces.** A bleakheart gains grim satisfaction in causing distress to the living, especially those who have recently experienced joy. By day, they lurk in deeply shadowed areas of settlements, usually around places of entertainment, and skim the thoughts of passersby. When a bleakheart detects someone who is elated, it follows them home for further observation. While its victim sleeps, the bleakheart probes their mind, causing the victim nightmares about the subject of their happiness. Once the victim awakens, its joy turned to pain, the bleakheart disguises itself as the personage who once brought the victim joy and reveals itself. Even while magically disguised, a bleakheart appears disquietingly out of focus.  \n**Undead Nature.** A bleakheart doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

This agony pulls on nearby creatures, drawing out vital fluids and ripping minor wounds into great injuries. The sentinel stores this blood inside itself, and the red veins in its stone become more prevalent the more blood it stores.  \n**Mindless Fury.** Those who create bloodstone sentinels invariably see power through the spilling of blood and utilize the construct to spread their faith.

Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food.

Some humanoids are born with runic symbols designating them as creatures blessed by the North Wind, but most must undergo several trials before the first wintry rune scrawls itself into their flesh. The trials include surviving the highest mountain peaks in the dead of winter, defeating a frost giant in single combat, and crafting a spear out of the fang or claw of an icy beast. Even then, Boreas may deny his favor.  \n**Blood and Weapons of Ice.** A humanoid chosen by Boreas goes through a transformation to become more like its patron. Its blood freezes into ice, and its weapons become forever rimed.  \n**Blessed and Loyal.** Humanoids chosen by Boreas further his goals, protect his holy sites, spread winter wherever they walk, and honor the North Wind with every fallen foe.",

Brain hoods often encourage this belief, sowing mistrust and discord between villagers and a local circle of druids. This practice, coupled with the brain hood’s abominable treatment of beasts, drives druids to hunt down and destroy brain hoods.

It clings to the ceiling, silently waiting for prey to appear below._  \nHighly adapted to hunting underground, this lesser cousin of true dragons stalks cavern passages for prey.  \n**Patient Predator.** An adult cave drake is between ten and fifteen feet long, with a thin, whip-like tail that nearly doubles its overall length. Its scales are dull and colored to match the surrounding stone. A cave drake hunts by lying in wait for prey to pass, often hanging from a wall or ceiling, before ambushing with its blinding venom. The drake then tracks the blinded creature as it flees, using a keen sense of smell and the creature’s disorientation to follow it. A cave drake will follow prey patiently for miles, unless its quarry wanders into the territory of another cave drake.  \n**Solitary Hunter.** The cave drake is a lone predator. It typically lairs in high-roofed caverns, atop sheer ledges, or in other areas where it can take advantage of its superior climbing ability. Each cave drake claims a wide expanse of tunnels and caverns as its territory. A cave drake will fight to defend its territory from all other creatures, including other cave drakes, with the exception of mating season, when territories fluctuate as female drakes search for mates. A female cave drake will lay two to five eggs, raising the young until they are able to hunt on their own, then driving them out.  \n**Hoards.** Like their true dragon kin, cave drakes collect treasure, favoring shiny metals and sparkling gemstones. They will often arrange such treasures near phosphorescent fungi, glowing crystals, or other sources of light. Unlike true dragons, cave drakes are not overly protective or jealous of their hoards. The more cunning of their kind often use such objects as bait to draw out greedy prey while they wait in ambush.",

    "desc": "A large chameleon pokes its head below the canopy. Soon, four other identical heads peek below the treetops. A massive body accompanies the heads, revealing they all belong to one creature. The creature’s odd feet and long, curled tail transport it from tree to tree with ease, and its sticky tongues allow it to slurp up prey on the forest floor as it passes._  \nThe chameleon hydra thrives in thick, wooded areas where it makes nests in the canopies of large trees. It feasts on prey both above and below the canopy, using its sticky tongues to snatch unsuspecting prey.  \n**Apex Ambush Predators.** Chameleon hydras have scales that react to light and allow the hydras to blend in with their surroundings. They are extremely patient, waiting until the most opportune time to strike from a safe vantage point. Chameleon hydras primarily eat birds and giant insects, but they are known to dine on unwary travelers if other prey is scarce.  \n**Curious and Colorful.** Study of juvenile chameleon hydras shows they have inquisitive minds and that they alternate their scales in colorful patterns when near others of their kind. Scholars believe they use these color changes as a rudimentary form of communication.",

They also rescue lost or trapped mortals of good or neutral alignment, leading the mortals to a place of safety or to the nearest portal back to the Material Plane. Despite their appearance, chamrosh can speak and readily do so with mortals they rescue or celestials they serve or protect. .  \n**Occasional Planar Travelers.** Chamrosh rarely travel to the Material Plane, but when they do, it is usually for an important mission, such as to defend a holy relic or to aid a paladin on a divine quest. Since a chamrosh cannot change its form, such missions do not generally involve infiltration or deception, and when the task is finished, the chamrosh is quick to return to its normal duties.",

When a person calls upon the chatterlome, they soon receive an intricately carved oaken box with an obsidian inlay of a humanoid heart. Upon touching the box, the supplicant immediately knows that the box must be delivered to the home of the person who wronged the supplicant. When the victim opens the box, the chatterlome springs forth, claiming the heart of the victim and fulfilling the supplicant’s request. Whether or not the box is opened, a chatterlome whose box has been delivered knows the location of the victim and tracks the person relentlessly. After the victim dies, the supplicant must then deliver the chatterlome’s box to nine more victims or forfeit their own life. A string of deaths occurring shortly after victims received mysterious boxes is a sure sign that a chatterlome is in the area.  \n**Box Devils.** Chatterlomes are often called “box devils” due to their peculiar ability to magically travel between boxes and other enclosed, wooden objects. Though chatterlomes can travel between boxes, each chatterlome has its original box, created when it was summoned by a supplicant who was scorned. If the chatterlome’s original box is destroyed, the chatterlome returns to the Hells, where it waits for another scorned lover to call it back to the Material Plane.",

Water drips from the claws, freezing before it hits the ground._  \n**Forlorn Spirits.** Chill haunts arise from the corpses of humanoids that froze to death. While most chill haunts derive from those who died alone in the cold, stories tell of entire families or villages returning as chill haunts. Because of the intensity of their demise, chill haunts dread cold and flee when targeted by cold magic.  \n**Hungry for Body Heat.** The chill haunt’s disdain for cold leads it to seek out warm buildings or open fires. While ambient heat or direct contact with fire diminishes its shivering and restores wounds it has received in combat, it craves heat from living creatures. Contact with the chill haunt sets off a deepening freeze in the victim, which is hard to reverse without the application of fire. The haunt comes into contact with living creatures to remember the feeling of warmth, and it does not care about the side effects of its touch. After it has drained the warmth from one creature, it immediately moves on to the next, ever-hungry.  \n**Restless Undead.** Destroying a chill haunt is only a temporary solution to the undead creature’s depredations. Similar to a ghost, a destroyed chill haunt returns to unlife 24 hours after its demise, attaining eternal rest only after being slain under a specific set of circumstances. For most chill haunts, the surest way to eternal rest is by coaxing the haunt to a warm building where it can sit by a hearth and nestle in blankets or furs. Though physical objects normally pass through the spectral creature, such conditions allow the coverings to conform to the shape of the haunt’s former body. Moments later, the haunt lets out a contented sigh and winks out of existence.  \n**Undead Nature.** A chill haunt doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Blood stains its maw, which leaks a green fluid with a vaguely astringent odor._  \n**Collectors of Blood.** Hags and other magic practitioners who require blood for their rituals and sacrifices create clockwork leeches to scout marshlands and neighboring settlements for large groups of living creatures. The leeches are designed to extract their fill and return to their controllers, who access and drain their reservoirs. Autonomous clockwork leeches continue to collect blood, but, without masters to whom they deliver it, they go through cycles of draining blood then violently disgorging it. Regardless of their purpose (or lack thereof) for obtaining blood, most clockwork leeches retreat after getting their fill.  \n**Waterproof Swimmer.** A clockwork leech has layered copper plating that keeps water away from its inner mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the leech to propel itself through water. They can use this propelling undulation on land to make attacks with their “tails.” Leeches that don’t receive regular cleanings eventually turn green as the copper corrodes.  \n**Unseen, Unheard, and Unfelt.** The same plating that protects the clockwork leech’s inner mechanisms also buffers noise from the gears. Its coloration allows it to blend in with marshland foliage and silty water. Finally, when it punctures a creature’s skin, it releases a sedative to numb the wound, leaving the victim unaware of the injury and subsequent blood drain. The leech doesn’t have an unlimited supply of the sedative, and a leech that hasn’t undergone maintenance for a few weeks loses its Anesthetizing Bite trait. Because the leech must remain attached to its victim to drain its blood, it prefers to attack lone or sleeping targets.  \n**Construct Nature.** A clockwork leech doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Some intelligent undead tame and train corpse worms, using them as pets, guardians, or shock troops.  \n**Slimy Eggs.** A female corpse worm lays up to two dozen eggs in crevasses, cul-de-sacs, or other remote areas. Corpse worm eggs are about the size of a human head and are sheathed in a rubbery, translucent gray membrane. The eggs are deposited with a sticky, mustard-colored excretion, allowing them to be placed on walls or even ceilings. This excretion exudes a powerful smell that many subterranean predators find unpleasant, and it allows the mother to relocate the eggs as she watches over them until they hatch.",

The pixies delight in these tasks, often using their magic to make people harm one another and remaining invisible as long as they can. Corrupted pixies like to make the pain last as long as possible before their tricks satisfyingly result in another creature’s death.  \n**Destroy Beauty.** Corrupted pixies take a special joy in destroying anything beautiful, be it a work of art, a garden, or the face of a handsome adventurer. The fiends sometimes become distracted from their hag-assigned tasks because the opportunity to mar something perfect is too good to pass up.  \n**Restored by Pixie Dust.** If a corrupted pixie is captured, it can be restored to its fey form.

    "desc": "This enormous, squat beast has a shaggy hide of ice. Two translucent horns protrude from its snout, the frontmost of which looks like a scimitar._  \n**Elemental-Touched Rhino.** A cryoceros resembles a woolly rhinoceros made of ice. Its thick, frozen hide protects the soft flesh at its core, and a layer of ice forms over its already formidable, keratinous horns. The creature’s body is efficient at transferring warmth to its fleshy interior; fire still harms a cryoceros, but its icy form is not unduly damaged by fiery attacks. A cryoceros has a second stomach that stores ice it consumes. As a defense mechanism, the cryoceros can spew stinging, pulverized ice from this alternate stomach.  \n**Slow Metabolisms.** Cryoceroses survive on stunted grasses and other plants that thrive in the tundra, as well as ice and snow, to replenish their icy exteriors. Despite their size, they don’t require a great deal of sustenance, and they conserve their energy by slowly grazing across frozen plains. Their ponderous movement fools the unwary into believing that distance equals safety. Indeed, cryoceroses endure much provocation before they decide to act, but they run at and spear or crush those who irritate them. Once their ire is up, they rarely give up pursuing the source of their anger; only by leaving their vast territories can one hope to escape them.  \n**Cantankerous Mounts.** Gentleness and a regular source of food temporarily earns the cryoceroses’ trust, and patient humanoids can manage to train the creatures to accept riders. This works for convenience much more than for combat, since cryoceroses balk at fighting with loads on their backs. A cryoceros in combat with a rider either stands stock still until its rider dismounts or, worse, rolls over to throw its rider, often crushing the rider in the process. Because of this, most tribes who train cryoceroses use the creatures as beasts of burden rather than war mounts.",

    "desc": "The cavern glitters with refracted light bouncing off thousands of crystals. A towering menhir of shimmering crystal dominates the center of the cavern._  \nWhether a rare evolution of silicate life or a wandering nomadic race from some alternate reality, crystalline monoliths are enigmatic beings found deep underground in caverns where giant crystals flourish and grow.  \n**Crystal Gardens.** Crystalline monoliths reside in areas of living crystal, these formations often growing to gigantic proportions, resembling the monolith itself. Some sages speculate that crystalline monoliths grow crystals to certain specifications, then use their magic to instill sentience in the crystals as a means of reproducing. Whether the gardens are for reproduction or some other mysterious purpose, the crystal monoliths are very protective of them. The environment of these gardens is often not comfortable for most humanoid life; the temperature may be extremely hot or cold, or the cavern may contain poisonous gases or even be partially-submerged in water.  \n**Magical Philosophers.** Crystalline monoliths prefer to spend their days in quiet contemplation. They tend their crystal gardens and meditate. If encountered by other intelligent creatures, they are generally open to exchanges of information and intellectual discussion. They prefer to communicate telepathically but can create sounds through vibrations that mimic speech. Aggressive intruders are dealt with according to the level of threat they exhibit. If the crystalline monolith considers the intruders unlikely to cause it harm, it will often use its magic to misdirect opponents or lure them away from the garden. Should the intruders persist or show themselves to be dangerous, a crystalline monolith is not above using its magic to crush and destroy them. It is especially unforgiving to those that try to steal or damage crystals in its lair.  \n**Crystalline Nature.** A crystalline monolith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.  \n\n## A Crystalline Monolith’s Lair\n\n  \nCrystalline monoliths lair in vast gardens of crystal in mountains or deep underground, often near areas of extreme temperature or geothermal activity. They harness the ambient magical energy in the crystals to defend themselves and repel intruders.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the crystalline monolith takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the crystalline monolith can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The crystalline monolith creates an illusory duplicate of itself in its space. The double moves or speaks according to the monolith’s mental direction. Each time a creature targets the monolith with an attack, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets the duplicate. On a roll of 11 or higher, the attack hits and destroys the duplicate. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine which monolith is real. On a success, the creature identifies the illusion. The duplicate is intangible, but otherwise is identical to the monolith by sight, smell, or hearing. The duplicate lasts for 1 minute or until the monolith uses this lair action again.\n* The crystalline monolith vibrates at a frequency that reverberates through the lair, causing the ground to tremble. Each creature on the ground within 60 feet of the monolith (except for the crystalline monolith itself) must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\n* Magically-charged shards of crystal fire from the crystals in the lair, striking up to two targets within 60 feet of the crystalline monolith. The crystalline monolith makes one ranged attack roll (+3 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and 2 (1d4) psychic damage.",

It opens its mouth in a shrill call, rotting meat dripping from its beak._  \nDeath vultures are giant birds transformed by their diet of undead flesh.  \n**Mutated Monstrosities.** When a giant vulture gorges on undead flesh, the necromantic magic suffused in the meal warps and changes the bird’s body. The vulture’s muscles bulge in odd places, making it stronger and tougher, its eyes burn with green fire, and it reeks of rot, earning these mutated monsters the name “death vultures.” The vulture also gains the ability to regurgitate necromantic energy, which can cause the flesh of living creatures to decay and age rapidly.  \n**Massive Meat Appetites.** Death vultures have incredible appetites and are far more willing to attack live prey than other vultures. They have a special taste for rotting flesh, and they use their decaying breath weapon to “season” their foes with necrotic energy before using their talons and beaks to tear apart their quarry.  \n**Necromancer Neighbors.** Death vultures often form kettles near the lairs of necromancers as they feed on their undead creations. While some necromancers find the birds to be a nuisance, many necromancers feed the vultures, encouraging them to stay. Most death vultures are willing to trade service as guardians of the lairs for food.",

Although they have eyes that can see light normally, their primary means of navigating the darkness is through vibration sense, which they register on their rubbery, sensitive skin.  \n**Malleable.** After these trolls moved underground, their bodies adapted to surviving in the smaller, often cramped caverns. Their bones became soft and malleable, allowing them to access areas deep beneath the surface world. Deep trolls can elongate their limbs and body or squeeze themselves ooze-like through tiny cracks and openings until they emerge into a place large enough to accommodate their natural size.  \n**Tribal.** Deep trolls live in small tribes of seven to fifteen members. They raid in groups, though they can be found alone when hunting or scavenging. They are intelligent enough to communicate, but they are voracious and can rarely be reasoned with when food is present. They prefer to attack anything potentially edible that isn’t part of the tribe and deal with the repercussions later. In rare cases, when confronted with opponents who are clearly more powerful, they can be persuaded to reason and discuss terms. Deep trolls are likely to agree to mutually beneficial terms, such as helping them deal with a common enemy or providing them with something they value.",

They possess the same alluring song all harpies have, but they can modulate the song to allow their captivated targets safe passage toward them. They often use their songs to prevent intruders from harming their home marshes. They can end their song in a mighty crescendo, imposing their will on those charmed by the song. The harpies typically coerce intruders to repair damages wreaked upon the marsh or to merely leave and never return. If a harpy suspects the intruders are unrepentant, she stops playing nice and allows her victims to fall prey to the marsh’s hazards.  \n**Powerful Yet Graceful.** The wings that hold the egret harpy’s larger frame aloft also serve as weapons.

Their most unsettling aspect—the constant spewing of plant material—is due to a strange regenerative factor. The trees spontaneously generate plant material, which negatively interacts with their acidic interiors and causes them near-constant digestive discomfort. The fleshdregs can direct this acidified material as a spew, which temporarily suspends this continual production, but they are hesitant to do so except in extreme circumstances. If they lose too much acid or their acid somehow becomes neutralized, the pulpy material fills their innards, bloating them and eventually erupting through their skin.  \n**Friendly Trees.** Many intelligent creatures encountering fleshdregs judge them by their horrifying features, but the fleshdregs are amiable hosts. They understand that many creatures find them repulsive and react to hostility with calming words and a show of peace. Assuming they establish a friendly footing with visitors, they prove to be valuable sources of information about the surrounding territory. In some cases, fleshdregs volunteer to accompany their new acquaintances within a swamp, especially if the fleshdregs seek to relocate.  \n**Otherworldly Origins.** Scholars who have studied the strange trees conclude they derive from some foreign environment. They are split on whether the creatures come from beyond the stars or migrated from deep within the underworld.

Relentlessly curious, flithidirs often take the form of a bird when they encounter strangers, quietly following and studying the creatures. If the strangers are deemed safe and intriguing, the flithidir approaches in a humanoid form to get better acquainted.  \n**Easily Bored.** Flithidirs tirelessly seek out new things. Some desire new experiences—songs and stories, unusual foods, and sudden discoveries—while others are more covetous, ceaselessly collecting objects they find interesting. Sometimes this greed manifests as a magpie-like desire for shiny things, but a flithidir is also just as likely to be fascinated by items of a certain shape, texture, or color. When a flithidir encounters someone who possesses a thing it wants, it may offer something in exchange— usually a splendid song or acrobatic display—or it may simply request the item with great charm, reacting with frustration or rage if the object is denied to it.",

The order enslaved every villager and conducted magical experiments upon them in the wizards’ remote mountain tower. The wizards were trying to create the perfect servitor race, using the villagers as a baser life form. The experiment failed spectacularly, unleashing a magical transformative wave upon the tower. Many of the wizards managed to escape, but all of the human slaves were caught in the magical chaos and were forever changed into gaunt ones.  \n**Undead Appearance.** At first glance, gaunt ones appear to be some form of undead creature, leading many to underestimate them. Their skin is pale, shrunken, and withered, and their teeth are yellow and jagged with receded gums.  \n**Hunger for Hearts.** Gaunt ones have an inherent hunger for hearts and often sit quietly for hours, listening for the heartbeats of nearby creatures. A gaunt one grabs hold of its prey and worms its tentaclelike tongue into the creature’s mouth to extract the creature’s heart. Insatiable, a gaunt one continues to eat the hearts of creatures it finds until there is nothing left to harvest. Lacking readily available food, it moves on.",

Their desire to help mortals leads them to more extreme climates, with a strong preference for colder weather. Ghillie dubhs find lost travelers and guide these unfortunates to safe places. If a traveler impresses a ghillie dubh with knowledge or a desire for knowledge about the forest, the ghillie dubh gifts the traveler with some of its knowledge.  \n**Punishment of Transgression.** Likewise, a ghillie dubh expects visitors to the area it oversees to be respectful of the land. Ghillie dubhs lecture mild violators and briefly use nature to inconvenience them, such as by covering paths or removing tracks. More heinous acts—like wantonly slaughtering animals or setting trees ablaze—are met with physical retaliation.  \n**Part of the Forest.** Ghillie dubhs take on characteristics of the forests they call home to blend in seamlessly with the trees and other plants. They can listen to subtle variations in the trees’ movements to receive early warning about attacks, and they can turn their attention to any part of the forest to ensure no harm is coming to an area.",

The creature’s long tail acts as a breathing tube for it, which is often harvested and used by intrepid explorers and inventors in the creation of diving bells and other apparatuses for traversing the stygian depths.",

Only the largest white dragons surpass the graknork in size and strength, and lesser creatures give the monster a wide berth. Graknorks are mostly found on land but are reasonable swimmers. They have no problem taking to the water to pursue escaping prey or to hunt fishermen and even whales. Graknorks are solitary creatures and cannot stand the presence of their own kind, attacking and eating juvenile graknorks that cross their path. When they do mate, it is a destructive affair with the female uprooting dozens of trees to build her nest. A typical graknork is more than forty feet long, though even larger specimens have been sighted in the coldest regions of the world.  \n**Great Blue Eye.** While the graknork’s raw physical prowess is justifiably feared, the aspect of its appearance that causes the greatest consternation is its great, freezing blue eye. Its eye is said to possess terrible and wondrous powers, including seeing through illusions, freezing souls outright, and causing everlasting blizzards. Most of these tales are mere fancy and hearsay spun by northern tribesmen, yet there is no denying that the graknork’s central eye is a fearsome weapon.",

Scholars believe the orcs’ ancestral home was ravaged by magic, cursing them and driving them deep beneath the surface. They believe this history fuels within the orcs a deep hatred for magic, especially magic that defiles the natural world. For their part, the orcs have neither confirmed nor denied this speculation, though few scholars have been brave enough to approach them about it. Whatever the case, gray orcs grow violent around magic and seek to snuff it out wherever they find it.  \n**Synchronized Tribes.** Gray orcs move and act as one, their training leading their actions to be so synchronized that they appear to think as one. When faced with a major threat or a large magical catastrophe, a group of gray orcs will erupt from the ground in unison to swarm over the source.",

When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.  \n**Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.  \n**Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna’s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways. The lunarchidna’s statistics change cyclically as shown on the Lunarchidna Moon Phase table.  \n\n#### Lunarchidna Moon Phase\n\nMoon Phase\n\nStatistics\n\nDaytime, new, or crescent moon\n\nOpen Game License",

Hoard drakes feed irregularly, gorging themselves on metals, minerals, and the occasional dwarf or goat when hunger finally gets the better of them. Hoard drakes are almost as vain as they are greedy and meticulously clean their scales to a polished gleam that matches their golden treasure. Hoard drakes lust after the hoards of true dragons and sometimes attack small dragons to steal their treasure or take over their lairs.  \n**Robbers Beware.** Strangely, hoard drakes are docile creatures that are open to conversation with visitors. However, hoard drakes are roused to terrible anger when even the smallest portion of their treasure is taken. At such times, a hoard drake leaves its lair to relentlessly pursue the thief, not resting until its treasure is reclaimed and the offending party is slain and eaten. A hoard drake never gives up any part of its hoard unless threatened with certain death. Even then, it doesn’t rest until the indignity it has suffered has been repaid in full.",

Hodags have been known to break down the doors of houses, barns, and other buildings to get at prey inside.  \n**Solo Hunters until Mating.** Hodags are generally solitary creatures with large territories. Babies are abandoned by their mothers after birth. There is an exception for one week each year in spring just after the end of winter. Hodags within several hundred miles instinctually gather in a prey-filled area, which never seems to be the same place twice. The hodags gorge on as much food as possible and engage in mating rituals. When the week is over, the hodags disperse, returning to their territories.  \n**Impossible to Train.** Hodags are born with strong predator instincts, which helps the young survive after being left by their mothers. Many believe this same instinct makes hodags impossible to train, but such claims only make them more valuable targets for those who collect exotic pets.",

It is adept at tailoring its performances to the crowd, switching effortlessly between charming plays, ribald performances, satirical pantomimes, and terrifying tales. During these performances, the jack of strings can take control of a creature in the audience to enact justice in the form of humiliation, torture, or even death. The jack is sometimes hired by fey nobility to enact such justice on rivals.  \n**Uncanny Valley.** The jack of strings takes control of its victims by establishing a link between the victim and one of its marionettes. When it establishes the link, the marionette becomes lifelike while the jack’s victim takes on a wooden appearance. The puppet gains the victim’s eyes, which disappear from the victim’s face.  \n**Masters of Puppets.** Jacks of strings have several marionettes at their disposal. Aside from the first, which it painstakingly crafts itself, the jack’s puppets derive from victims who perish while linked to the jack’s puppet. Jacks harvest their prey in the mortal realm under the guise of a traveling entertainer and typically target people who won’t be missed.",

    "desc": "A thick, snakelike creature made of thousands of blades of kelp rises above the water’s surface. Flyaway blades swirl from the primary mass as the creature winds itself around its hapless prey._  \nKelp eels were accidentally created by merfolk arcanists who desired to protect their community from the myriad threats facing them. They attempted to bring the kelp forests near their settlement to life to entangle attackers, slowing them long enough to allow the merfolk to repel them. Instead, the first kelp eels were born as the blades of kelp wove themselves into massive eely forms that ravaged the very community they were created to protect.  \n**Serpents of the Shallows.** Since their creation, kelp eels have spread across the ocean. Forests of sentient kelp grow in ocean shallows, scarcely different to the casual observer from any other marine jungle. As the kelp matures, the blades wind around the thallus and eventually detach from its holdfast as a full-grown kelp eel. The kelp eel then moves on to an unclaimed shallow and attempts to create a new forest.  \n**Mariners’ Nightmares.** The presence of a kelp eel is a blight upon people whose livelihoods depend on the ocean. The voracious eels are known to overturn boats and to drag their occupants to a watery grave. Kelp-entwined humanoid remains are common on the floor of kelp eel forests. Experienced sailors sometimes chum the waters as they approach a kelp forest, hoping to attract other large ocean predators to distract the local kelp eels.  \n**Deep Hunters.** While kelp eels live and breed in shallower waters, it isn’t uncommon for them to hunt the ocean deeps if fertilizer is proving scarce near their forest. Knowledgeable mariners know that the presence of dead whales, sharks, and giant squid in shallow waters could be an indicator of kelp eel activity.",

Their original purpose was to seek out and destroy nests of rats and other city-dwelling vermin, but they regularly find themselves employed as living lockpicks. Their sensitivity to vibrations helps them find prey no matter where it is hidden, and their long, deft tongues enable them to pick even the most complex of locks. Dragonettes have difficulty delineating between pests and pets, and they sometimes consume the furry companions of the people whose homes they are ridding of vermin.  \n**Big Eaters.** Belying their small frames, keyhole dragonettes have voracious appetites and can consume a variety of foods. Aside from meat, they enjoy fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Keyhole dragonettes with easy access to sugary foods often develop a sweet tooth.  \n**Loyal Companions.** Guards, wilderness scouts, and rogues of all types often see the value in taking a keyhole dragonette as a companion. Young dragonettes are easy to train and eagerly bond with people, quickly becoming steadfast friends with their caretakers. If the person a dragonette has bonded to dies or leaves, the dragonette becomes despondent. The depression can last for years if something doesn’t occur to lift the creature’s spirits.",

It then waits patiently for its prey to draw near—before striking out at them with its lightning-fast bite.  \n**Symbiotic Relationship.** The mist that covers a kirikari’s body comes from a unique type of mold that adheres to its carapace. The mold secretes an acid that evaporates harmlessly shortly after being exposed to air. The kirikari uses this mist to conceal itself and disorient its prey. Despite being natural-born swimmers, kirikari tend to avoid swimming in ocean waters, as exposure to salt quickly kills its mold.  \n**Wyvern Hunters.** Though unusual for its behavior, kirikari have been known to travel incredible distances to hunt down wyverns.

These hangers-on are adept at locating hard-to-reach places on their prey as they wriggle into gaps in armor or crawl into boots. Their victims must spend extra time to locate and remove them.",

When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.  \n**Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer.

These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.  \n**Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna’s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways.

All the while, a harrowing tune plays from the column of pipes rising from its core._  \nMad pipers are the heralds of the Great Old Ones, a sign that a cult is getting close to achieving their goals. Cultists receive visions from their masters, filling their dreams with the esoteric rituals needed to create a mad piper. In short order, the cult gathers the components and creates these creatures, typically one for each cell of the cult. When the time comes for the cult to do battle, the mad pipers follow, inspiring the faithful with the alien songs of the Great Old Ones.  \n**The Ritual.** During the ritual, five humanoids, one of which must be a musician of some kind, are tied to a set of bagpipes made from an ogre’s bones and stomach. The ritual liquefies the humanoids, who fall into each other as all but their limbs and heads dissolve into a mass of grey flesh. Their minds, souls, and bodies forcefully merged, they start to play.  \n**Pets and Mascots.** Mad pipers aren’t naturally evil. Most are made from commoners, resulting in relatively docile and loyal creatures that imprint quickly onto cult members, who in turn often come to treat these abominations as pets. More violent and powerful mad pipers can be made from powerful, evil humanoids, though they are harder to control and often hostile to their creators.  \n**True Pipers.** Scholars speculate that the mad pipers are modelled after the heralds of the Crawling Chaos, and that it was he who gifted the first ritual to mortals on behalf of all Great Old Ones.  \n**Construct Nature.** The mad piper doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

    "desc": "A pile of red, gooey flesh slurps along the ground. The meat climbs upon itself, squishing as it creates a formidable, hungry wall._  \nMalleables are malevolent, formless piles of flesh that absorb psychic energy and grow smarter and stronger when combined together.  \n**Consumers of Psychic Power.** Creatures that consume psychic energy can become so infused with it that their bodies implode. The power lingers in the grotesque mass of flesh, warping the creature’s mind even more than its body and creating a hunter that hungers to consume and grow. Malleables do not remember their personal lives before implosion, but they do retain facts and lore. They think themselves superior to all other creatures, which are simply prey. Their goals are simple: drain every creature they can of psychic energy and rule the world as a massive, roiling meat puddle. Malleables have infinite patience and can wait centuries until they feel the time is right to go on a psychic energy binge.  \n**Many Shapes.** Malleables have no set form, but they can stretch and alter their forms easily, moving on appendages or flowing like an ooze. They might form a face (or many faces at once) if they wish to convey an emotion to another creature, or take the shape of a truly terrifying beast (like a giant spider) if they wish to create panic. No matter the shape they take, malleables always appear to be a fleshy creature turned inside out.  \n**Our Powers Combined.** Malleables can join together, creating a larger, more powerful creature that shares the intellect of all the combined intelligences. These bigger malleables can separate into smaller aberrations when it suits them.  \n**Ancient Knowledge Hoarders.** It is said that malleables have perfect memories and the oldest of these creatures remember ancient lore other creatures have long forgotten. Many sages have tried and failed to capture malleables to prod their minds for secrets, but the creatures almost always find a way to escape. Adventurers are often given the dangerous tasks of capturing, guarding, or questioning a malleable.",

Malleables have infinite patience and can wait centuries until they feel the time is right to go on a psychic energy binge.  \n**Many Shapes.** Malleables have no set form, but they can stretch and alter their forms easily, moving on appendages or flowing like an ooze. They might form a face (or many faces at once) if they wish to convey an emotion to another creature, or take the shape of a truly terrifying beast (like a giant spider) if they wish to create panic. No matter the shape they take, malleables always appear to be a fleshy creature turned inside out.  \n**Our Powers Combined.** Malleables can join together, creating a larger, more powerful creature that shares the intellect of all the combined intelligences. These bigger malleables can separate into smaller aberrations when it suits them.  \n**Ancient Knowledge Hoarders.** It is said that malleables have perfect memories and the oldest of these creatures remember ancient lore other creatures have long forgotten. Many sages have tried and failed to capture malleables to prod their minds for secrets, but the creatures almost always find a way to escape. Adventurers are often given the dangerous tasks of capturing, guarding, or questioning a malleable.",

They have been known to track their prey far from their native mountains, across continents and into mortal cities. When a nymph catches up to her mark, she harries it without mercy or remorse. A nymph’s mark, assuming it has done nothing to offend or harm the nymph, can throw the nymph off its tail by exiting her territory and leaving tribute of freshly hunted meat and strong drink.",

They live among the peaks, climbing seemingly impossible slopes to make their homes in the caves and burrows they dig near the tops. Ages ago, they had amicable relations with nearby settlements, but their aggressive behavior and boorish attitudes led to conflicts with the populace. They were subsequently made to withdraw from civilization as a result. In the years since, they have become an insular people, fearful of outsiders and resentful of civilization.  \n**Communal.** Mountain striders live in communal groups that travel the mountains, moving with the seasons. They are highly protective of each other and go into a brief rage when one of their number falls. Their nomadic and overly protective natures occasionally bring them into conflict with dwarves, though the two don’t actively hunt each other.  \n**Bleating Communication.** The weather on the highest mountain peaks can turn at a moment’s notice, separating family groups within minutes. The mountain striders adapted to such dangers by developing complex bleating calls. Over time, these calls became part of the mountain striders’ culture, seeing use outside of emergency situations. The calls range from simple notifications of an individual’s location or health to short songs identifying family affiliation and lineage.",

Those who study murgriks believe the creatures are ordinary alligators warped by their proximity to that plane. Their cruelty and preference for intelligent prey both lend credence to the notion that the Abyssa has influenced their mutations.  \n**Afraid of Herons.** The only known way to deter a murgrik from attacking is to introduce a heron, real or illusory. The reason a murgrik retreats from herons is a mystery, but it may point to the existence of a demonic bird that preys on murgriks.",

Orphans of the black carry no weapons or belongings, except for a single tattered blanket or broken toy.  \n**Problem with Authority.** Orphans of the black hate those who hold command over others. Whenever possible, creatures prominently displaying rank or other titles, along with those who issue orders. An orphan of the black may sympathize with a creature that feels belittled or neglected, and it might forgo attacking the creature to attempt to coerce the creature into becoming an orphan of the black as well.",

Its piecemeal leather armor and weapon at the ready give the impression it is prepared for a fight._  \n**Foe to Reptilians.** While generally peaceful creatures, otterfolk bear an enmity for reptilians, owing to their near extinction in the jaws of giant alligators and other large swamp predators. They are wary of intelligent reptilian creatures, such as lizardfolk and naga, who regularly prey on their people. Otterfolk pass this animosity on to future generations through tales of heroic otterfolk overcoming ferocious snakes and mighty alligators. From the time an otterfolk kit can walk, it learns how to wield the atlatl and to be mindful of the presence of their hated foes. Otterfolk are wary of reptilian visitors or those accompanied by reptiles, but they are cordial to all others.  \n**Swamp Guides.** Otterfolk are excellent sources of information about the territory surrounding their homes, and they often escort friendly visitors through the swamp. The price for this service depends on the combat capabilities of those they escort. Their overwhelming martial outlook causes them to value visitors who can prove themselves in combat. If a group seems capable of protecting itself, the otterfolk reason they don’t have to defend the group in addition to guiding it. They often ask such groups for a pittance in rations or monetary value (preferring pearls to other valuable items). Otterfolk greatly increase their fees for groups apparently incapable of fighting off potential swamp hazards. However, they pride themselves on never abandoning their charges.  \n**Otter Trainers.** Otterfolk often raise river otters as guard animals and pets, which serve the same function in their society as dogs in human societies. Otterfolk regard the animals warmly and become sad when favored pets die. They rarely allow their otters to engage in combat. They regularly hold contests where otter owners show off their training prowess by directing their otters in feats of strength, cunning, and dexterity. These contests never involve pitting the otters against each other in combat. The rare few otterfolk who choose to become wizards take otters as familiars. Otterfolk rangers often raise larger river otter specimens (use the statistics of a Open Game License",

When they sense danger, they fill their caps to gain height then release the air, using the flattened caps to slow their descent.  \n**Migrating Fungus.** Their ability to float allows pixie’s umbrellas to make homes on hard-to-reach surfaces, frustrating those who enjoy the mushrooms’ bitter flesh. The ground beneath wall- and cliff-dwelling pixie’s umbrellas is sometimes littered with the skeletal remains of starving travelers who fell in their desperate attempts to gather food.  \n**Dizzying Drifters.** Witnessing the migration of a colony of pixie’s umbrellas can be fascinating to those who enjoy watching large numbers of the mushrooms float from cavern to cavern. Intelligent Underworld hunters sometimes use the migration of pixie’s umbrellas to mask their approach, counting on the display to distract their prey.",

When threatened by civilized folk, qiqirn are quick to flee. When this occurs, a qiqirn often returns by night to steal the food or livestock it was previously denied. When qiqirn attacks have driven an entire community to hunt it, the monster leaves the region for easier hunting grounds.  \n**Spirit Dog.** A qiqirn’s fear of civilization is built on the basis of self-preservation.

They seldom wander back to their planes of origin and are almost always destroyed at some point during their eternal wanderings.  \n**Hunger for Magic.** Radiant spark swarms are drawn to magic for reasons that aren’t fully understood, for they can neither use it, nor do they truly devour it. Instead, when they sense powerful magic nearby, they instinctually move toward it, as though its very presence is comforting to them. As creatures that are neither particularly intelligent nor evil, their interest in the living usually has to do with the magic spellcasters carry, which draws the sparks close.

A repository can also use the power of language as a psychic assault, uttering words of power to attack the very minds of its enemies.  \n**Right Tool for the Job.** The chest cavity of a repository contains an extradimensional space that functions like a bag of holding, granting the repository the ability to pull out any tool that may be required.

Similarly, a repository can store anything it needs to protect in this extra-dimensional space. The repository is the only creature capable of retrieving items from this space while it is alive.

It uses its proboscis to deposit acidic saliva onto the rock, breaking it down and lapping up the liquefied minerals. A rock roach’s metabolism is slow to match its tedious eating process. Even still, a group of rock roaches can make quick work of a rocky wall, opening up routes between caverns. The roaches aren’t concerned for structural integrity and their eating habits, if left unimpeded, often lead to cave-ins.  \n**Naturally Hostile.** Rock roaches are instinctually hostile to anything that wanders near them, including each other. The roaches mate annually, and the parents abandon the eggs shortly after laying them. Young rock roaches band together for the first few months of life, protecting each other as they devour the rock where they hatched, then dispersing once they are large enough to defend themselves.  \n**Valuable Carapace.** The carapace of a rock roach is sought after by some groups of underground humanoids. Naturally resilient and hard, craftsman harvest the carapace and slowly sculpt it into a suit of armor in a month-long process that requires regular boiling of the tough carapace.",

    "desc": "A tall, ape-like creature walks upright, its arms ending in heavy fists. The creature’s lips curl back, revealing long, pointed teeth set in a powerful jaw._  \nSasquatches are large beasts that stalk deep forests and other densely wooded areas. They are bipedal primates that stand about nine feet tall and are covered in black, brown, or red fur.  \n**Famously Elusive.** Many people claim to have seen a sasquatch, but almost none have proof of their interaction with the beast, creating questions about the creature’s existence. Skeptics claim sasquatch sightings are simply misidentified bears, apes, or similar creatures. Many sages and hunters journey deep into forests, hoping to find proof sasquatches exist and returning only with a handful of fur that could belong to almost any animal. In truth sasquatches are solitary nocturnal creatures that generally avoid confrontation. They prefer to stay in the shadows of the forest, dining on vegetation and insects while staying clear of other creatures.  \n**Hidden Lairs.** Sasquatches are smart enough to hide the entrances to their lairs with heavy boulders, underbrush, fallen trees, a waterfall, or some other obstruction that appears to be a natural part of the terrain. They hide gathered food and shiny trinkets they find in the forest in these cozy homes, where they rest during daylight hours.  \n**Aggressive When Provoked.** Though sasquatches prefer to avoid confrontation, they fight savagely when cornered or if another creature threatens their home or food source. Their powerful fists and teeth make formidable weapons. Sasquatches do not hesitate to initiate a conflict when threatened.  \n**Attracted and Soothed by Music.** There are some who claim sasquatches are drawn and calmed by music, particularly songs with a lullaby-like quality. These tales come with a warning: stopping the song before the sasquatch is lulled to sleep by its melody causes the beast to go into a violent rage.",

However, their beaks bestow unluck on those touched or struck by them. The ibises usually reserve their cursed attacks as retribution for themselves, but swamp dwellers sometimes plea for the birds’ intercession on those who have wronged them. Scarlet ibises have keen judgment to determine the worthiness of these requests. Those who know about scarlet ibises and their terrible curses avoid killing the birds and typically warn others about the consequences of killing them. Less scrupulous folk instead encourage naïve travelers to destroy a scarlet ibis then pick off the travelers suffering from the aftereffects of combat with the birds.  \n**Dream Portent.** The scarlet ibis is a symbol of ill omens that appears in dreams. This omen precedes a setback—such as inclement weather, a tremor, the group getting lost, or a lame mount or pack animal—but it can also indicate a doomed mission. After a series of unfortunate incidents, the scarlet ibis makes a physical appearance, signifying the bad luck has ended. This sometimes incites the unfortunates to avenge themselves on the bird under the mistaken belief the ibis is the cause of the problems.  \n**Egret Harpy Friends.** Scarlet ibises congregate with Open Game License",

Their translucent skin and internal organs allow them to blend in with water and against icy backgrounds. Against other backgrounds, they leave a telltale shimmer, giving them their name. However, the seals can still take the unwary by surprise in less-than-ideal conditions. The only time the seal fully loses it translucency is when it consumes its diet of fish or small mammals, during which observers receive a breathtaking (or nauseating) view of the seals’ digestive process. The seals are aware of this vulnerability and usually feast in hidden locations. Arctic druids and rangers who successfully befriend shimmer seals use them as spies or as an advance wave of attack.  \n**Guardian of Seals.** Though shimmer seals notionally look like harbor seals, they are found among many different species of seal. Scholars who have studied the strange seals concluded shimmer seals are created when the spirits of creatures passionate about protecting overhunted animals merge with those of ordinary seals. When a shimmer seal dies protecting a pod of seals from hunters, one of the seals transforms into a new shimmer seal within a minute of the other shimmer seal’s death, reinforcing this theory. While shimmer seals are vigilant against hunting by humanoids, they allow natural predators to cull the seals under their protection, understanding the natural order and its importance.  \n**Rallying Seal.** A shimmer seal allows other seals to see it, and it can allow allied creatures to locate it. The presence of a shimmer seal emboldens the seals under its protection, transforming a pod of seals that might scatter in the face of armed opposition into an army of teeth and flippers, with the shimmer seal leading the counterattack. No one knows if the shimmer seal is aware of its ability to reincarnate shortly after it dies, but its fearlessness points to it possessing a certainty of survival.",

Shriekbat echolocation uses subsonic frequencies, allowing the bats to fly in relative silence.  \n**Kobold Companions.** Kobold bat keepers know the secret to raising young shriekbats. The bat keepers often risk their lives to procure young, using the bats for protection and as companions. A bat keeper returns its shriekbat to the wild before the bat reaches adulthood, when it would become too large for the cramped kobold tunnels. A bat keeper tracks the shriekbats it releases, and often returns to visit its former companions. Shriekbats prove surprisingly keen at remembering former kobold handlers (whether such handlers treated them well or poorly), and they often allow fondly remembered handlers to take a single pup from their litters, ensuring the pup survives to adulthood and renewing the cycle.  \n**Long-Lived Omnivores.** Shriekbats live for nearly 50 years. They are social and promiscuous creatures that live in small groups in large caverns. They are omnivorous but prefer fresh meat to other food with lizards taking up the majority of their diet. Shriekbats can survive on rotten flesh, which allows them to eat ghouls and other undead populating the Underworld, but they find it less palatable. In overcrowded situations where multiple groups of shriekbats roost in the same cavern, a group of shriekbats might break away to find another hunting location if food becomes scarce.",

These replicas are smaller, weaker clones of the shukankor that obey its telepathic commands and even sacrifice themselves to protect their creator. Shukankors are neither female nor male and reproduce by allowing their replicas to remain alive. After a day, these replicas become free-thinking and separate from the parent shukankor.

After the victim dies, the shurale cuts it into pieces, leaving the remains for the scavengers.  \n**Feeds on Laughter.** A shurale feeds on the sobbing laughs of its victims as they expire, its own health mysteriously revitalized in the process. Because of this, shurale lairs are typically located within a few miles of a humanoid settlement, where it can easily lure lone inhabitants into the woods. While most of their prey are humanoids living in alpine or heavily forested regions, shurales are not picky and have been known to attack orcs, ogres, trolls, and even hill giants.  \n**Woodcutter’s Curse.** Many believe that a shurale is the spirit of a woodcutter who died a lonely and embittered death after being ridiculed by family. While such an occurrence would be exceedingly rare and most sages scoff at such suggestions, the shurale’s skill with the woodcutter’s axe and its strange behavior cannot be denied.",

The presence of a silenal is usually discovered slowly by the owner. Perhaps they notice the bar towels have all been mended or that the empty bottles have been placed outside the back door. If the owner accepts this assistance and leaves small gifts of food and drink, the silenal becomes more active. After hours, the silenal spends its time ensuring the establishment is cleaned to a shine and ready for the next day’s business. If the owner and the silenal are at odds, however, the small mischiefs and mishaps caused by the silenal quickly drive the owner out of business.  \n**Flawed Advisors.** While the business is open, a silenal spends most of its time drinking and conversing with the patrons. Sileni are curious about mortals and find their tales and troubles fascinating. If a creature conversing with a silenal asks it for advice, the counsel received is invariably flawed. The silenal, interested in hearing more dramatic tales, offers guidance which is guaranteed to get its conversation partner in hot water in the hopes the recipient will return to lament new, entertaining troubles.  \n**Calm in the Storm.** Regardless of how chaotic activity gets in its bar, the silenal is strangely unaffected. Tavern brawls, whether caused by the silenal or not, never target it. The damage caused by fights is also reduced and rarely results in more than a few broken chairs and tankards.",

When the master of the hounds was tormented by a hag, he struck a deal with a powerful fey lord, requesting that his stock be blessed with the ability to hunt the witch. The hounds were returned to him, empowered and mutated, but capable of making short work of the hag nonetheless. After the houndmaster was ostracized for keeping monstrous pets, he grew resentful and concluded that the fey lord had wronged him. He arrogantly set out with his spellhounds after the fey lord that had created them, but he never returned. Ever since, spellhounds have been kept as prized pets by warring fey or set loose in fey-inhabited forests to prey on lonely spellcasters.  \n**Magical Predators.** Spellhounds have olfactory capabilities that allow them to sense the “odor” of spellcasters. This, combined with their spell-repelling coats and their magic-disrupting howls, makes them a menace for anyone with even a minor arcane faculty.",

Blinded by anguish, she seeks to erase any trace of those who betrayed her.  \n**Primordial Sacrifice.** Long ago, this woman was offered up to powerful spirits to ward off drought and famine. She served her role faithfully. Her shrine was maintained by a ritual of devotion performed by the descendants of those she loved, but it was eventually abandoned. Now, some transgression against her abandoned shrine has drawn the maiden back to the world.  \n**Abating the Storm.** A region plagued by a storm maiden experiences regular flooding and random tornadoes and lightning strikes. A community may yet atone for their ancestral betrayal by performing a long-forgotten ritual at the maiden’s shrine. If appeased, the storms end, and the maiden’s alignment changes from evil to good. An appeased maiden may go on to protect the region for generations, as long as her shrine is maintained, or she might wander to other regions, seeking communities in need who understand the importance of maintaining her shrine.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A storm maiden doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Its physical form is reminiscent of snakes, and marsh plants grow from its head. The naga’s strong tie to the swamp provides an impetus to protect its home and to believe it is the swamp’s sovereign. Because of this strong link, a swamp rarely hosts more than one naga, unless it covers vast territory.  \n**Insect and Serpent Friend.** The swamp naga’s link to the swamp extends to many creatures within it. Humanoids and mammalian animals that share the swamp with the naga recognize it as a protector and rarely trouble it, though the naga exerts no control over them. A cloud of poisonous biting and stinging insects accompanies the naga, endangering those who draw close to it.  \n**Necessarily Ruthless.** Scholars who have studied the connection between swamp nagas and their domains postulate the nagas’ malevolence is an outgrowth of swamplands’ inherent evil. However, the nagas only use force when trespassers actively harm the swamp or refuse to leave after the nagas attempt to reason with them. Nagas typically encourage those they enthrall to either leave or repair damages. They prefer not to take slaves, since this encourages more intruders and likely further havoc.",

They surround their victims’ heads and extract these gases, usually in copious quantities as their victims panic and breathe harder. This leads many to believe the bubbles are sadistic. However, encounters with swampgas bubbles are rarely fatal, since the bubbles typically sate themselves by the time their prey falls unconscious, losing interest as the creature’s breathing slows.  \n**Attracted to Fire.** A swampgas bubble is instinctively drawn to fire, even though they are highly flammable. Its susceptibility to fire makes it relatively easy to dispatch, but its explosive ending makes the use of fire risky for its foes. In fact, this form of death, accompanied by a beautiful burst of blue light, is just part of the bubble’s overall lifecycle. Its outer layer hardens and shatters, and the remaining bits fall into the swamp where they grow and encase swamp gasses, developing into new swampgas bubbles.  \n**Ooze Nature.** A swampgas bubble doesn’t require sleep.",

The villains of many children’s nightmares, thin giants are feared even by other giants, as their life-draining bite and ability to get into tight spaces make them unsettling at best and horrifying at worst. Thin giants don’t get along with most creatures, but they have been observed leading groups of ghouls, ettercaps, and trolls to capture and devour prey.  \n**Contortion Experts.** Thin giants have remarkable control over their bodies. They can twist their limbs into unnatural positions and even bend completely double. The flexibility and elasticity help the giants shrug off crushing blows. They can stay in contorted positions for extraordinary lengths of time and use this to their advantage to ambush unsuspecting creatures.",

When qiqirn attacks have driven an entire community to hunt it, the monster leaves the region for easier hunting grounds.  \n**Spirit Dog.** A qiqirn’s fear of civilization is built on the basis of self-preservation.

When this magic coalesces on a spider web touched by the light of a full moon, the web animates. The web gains life and flies through the forest, gathering other webs until it collects enough silk to form a faceless, humanoid body, with four legs and four arms.  \n**Hatred of Elves.** Lunarchidnas hate elves and love to make the creatures suffer. They poison water sources, set fire to villages, and bait monsters into stampeding through elf communities. These aberrations especially enjoy stealing away elf children to use as bait to trap the adults that come to the rescue.  \n**Cyclical Power.** The lunarchidna’s power is tied to the moon. When the skies are dark during a new moon, the lunarchidna becomes more shadow than living web. Its mental ability dulls, and it becomes barely more than a savage animal. When a full moon brightens the night, however, the lunarchidna becomes a conduit of lunar light and can channel that power through its body. Using its heightened intellect, it makes plans, writes notes, and plots from the safety of the trees where it makes its home. In the intermittent phases of the moon, the lunarchidna is a more than capable hunter, trapping and devouring prey it encounters while retaining enough knowledge of its plans and magic to further its goals in minor ways. The lunarchidna’s statistics change cyclically as shown on the Lunarchidna Moon Phase table.  \n\n#### Lunarchidna Moon Phase\n\nMoon Phase\n\nStatistics\n\nDaytime, new, or crescent moon\n\nOpen Game License",

Attracted to anything that glitters, jangles, or just plain smells nice, the valkruung steals anything regardless of its actual worth. Valkruungs snatch purses from unsuspecting passersby and fruit and bread from vendors to take back to their lairs. They steal objects they don’t need and refuse to return them, running off while snickering wildly.  \n**Shrines of Riches.** Anything a valkruung steals and doesn’t eat is placed in a central location in its nest, often around an existing statue, altar, or other large object. Eventually, this object becomes covered in a variety of clutter, some of which may be valuable. A valkruung treats all of its objects equally and attacks anyone who tries to take something from the pile.  \n**Den of Thieves.** Valkruungs are social creatures and live in groups of ten to twenty. The job of child-rearing is shared by all members of the group equally, and young valkruungs spend the first parts of their lives carried around on various adults’ backs, where the adults’ tendrils keep them safe. Valkruungs are more intelligent than they appear and have a rudimentary grasp of language, typically insults that have been hurled their way.",

Despite the vine drake’s plant-like nature, it is still a carnivorous dragon. It prefers deer and other game animals, but it has no problem eating the odd humanoid when it is truly hungry. In the absence of food, it can subsist, though barely, on sunlight if it spends time sunbathing.  \n**Avaricious Bullies.** Vine drakes share the typical greed possessed by most dragons and often shake down humanoids for treasure in return for safe passage through the drakes’ territory. They prefer emeralds and other green precious items that blend with their coloration, and they often secret such items deep within the tangle of vines on their bodies. They usually initiate their demands by grabbing unsuspecting victims in their vines and then threatening to strangle their captured prey unless given green treasures. However, they balk at strong resistance and withdraw into undergrowth if grievously harmed or if they face opponents they can’t overcome.  \n**Flightless Dragons.** Unlike most dragons, vine drakes can’t fly. In their claustrophobic swampy lairs, flight is not necessary. Instead, they use their grasping vines to quickly climb and move from tree to tree to hunt or evade predators.",

    "desc": "The beautiful singer bows to the adoring crowd before stepping behind the curtain. Away from the eyes of the crowd, the singer changes its half-mask, briefly revealing a ghastly, undead visage._  \nA virtuoso lich is an artist whose love of art sustains it beyond death.  \n**Birthed by Art.** A virtuoso lich is created when an artist powerful in both its artistic and magical expression dies with art left undone. Such artists often die before completing or creating a masterpiece, and the torment of the art left undone couples with the artist’s powerful magical talents, turning the artist into a virtuoso lich. A virtuoso lich is bound to an object of art, such as a favorite musical instrument, painting, dance slippers, quill, or some other object of artistic expression that was significant to the lich in life. This piece of art is the lich’s phylactery.  \n**Beautiful Mien.** A virtuoso lich maintains the beauty of its former life, appearing much as it did in life—save for one physical feature that betrays its undead nature. This undead feature can be a clawed, skeletal hand, which the lich hides in a glove; a stiff, zombie-like leg, which the lich disguises with robes and a cane; a face ravaged by undeath, which the lich covers in a beautiful mask; or any other appropriate feature.  \n**Undead Nature.** The virtuoso lich doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.  \n\n## A Virtuoso Lich’s Lair\n\n  \nA virtuoso lich chooses a lair with an eye and ear for artistic potential, whether that lair is an ancient cavern with natural acoustics, a meadow with plentiful natural light, a hall of mirrors, or some other locale capable of enhancing some form of art, allowing the lich’s magic and artistic expression to swell, reaching every corner.  \n\n### Lair Actions\n\n  \nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the virtuoso lich takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the lich can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n* The virtuoso lich channels artistic expression it can see or hear into a magical assault. The artistic expression must be of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait, but it otherwise can be any form of expression not originating from the lich, such as the song of nearby singers that echoes in the lair, the colorful paint decorating canvases, the twirling forms of dancers, or similar. The virtuoso lich chooses a creature it can see within 30 feet of the artistic expression. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) damage of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n* The virtuoso lich enhances the natural artistry of its lair, distracting and hindering nearby creatures. The lich chooses a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature has disadvantage on saving throws against the lich’s spells and its Corrupted Art action until initiative count 20 on the next round.\n* The virtuoso lich rolls a d4 and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.",

It has three forward-facing, segmented eyes and a protruding, bloodstained proboscis._  \n**Unknown Origins.** The origins of the wardu are unknown, though scholars speculate that they came from the Plateau of Leng. It is said they were introduced to the Material Plane as a result of an ill-fated expedition by a group of wizards to the edges of the multiverse. The wizards were attacked by a horde of wardu who followed them through the planar rift they created to return home. Although the rift was sealed immediately, dozens of the wardu were trapped on the Material Plane and have since reproduced for numerous generations.  \n**Blood Drinkers.** Wardu are blood drinkers, and it is the only way they absorb sustenance. They are able to attack and gain sustenance from any creature that has blood, no matter the type. Their hunger drives them to attack most creatures they encounter, though they are smart enough to discern the difference between a potential food source and a more powerful creature not worth provoking.  \n**Magic Hunters.** Wardus have a thirst for the blood of spellcasters and even put themselves at risk to obtain that tastiest of treats. Drinking arcane-infused blood has imbued the wardu with some magical power. It can channel this power through its central eye, but the segmented nature of its eye causes the magic to become unstable and scatter as it passes through the eye’s facets.",

When they are alone, they spend much of their time traversing the territory surrounding their homes, watchful for creatures in dire straits or in need of shelter. Wintergrims offer assistance and lodging to travelers they encounter and jump to the rescue for those in immediate peril. They readily share the furs in which they bundle themselves and are often laden with warm soups and beverages they share with visitors suffering from the elements.  \n**Inscrutable Rules.** A wintergrim’s hospitality has limits, as each wintergrim has a unique set of behaviors it holds taboo within the confines of its home. Breaking its rules is so abhorrent to a wintergrim, it dares not even discuss the things it forbids. The rules range from the seemingly innocuous—such as leaving one’s boots on when entering a wintergrim’s home—to common societal norms—such as not attacking or killing another guest. Discovering a wintergrim’s proscribed behavior is difficult, since the wintergrim ignores transgressions outside its home, perhaps giving a cryptic warning that it wouldn’t tolerate the same in its domicile. Mere discussion about its rules may also provoke the fey.  \nWhatever the case, wintergrims demand rulebreakers leave their premises at once, resorting to pummeling those who fail to comply.  \n**Competent Woodsfolk.** As loners with occasional guests, wintergrims are necessarily self-sustaining. They are omnivorous, and they grow gardens, set traps, and hunt for their food. Though they are inured to cold temperatures, they enjoy having a house in which they can reside and share their hospitality. They are adept with the axes they wield to chop down trees for their homes and fires, but they are careful not to overharvest wood. Other than when they hunt, they rarely use their axes as weapons. They prefer to punch their opponents in the hope they can drive their foes away, resorting to their axes only in desperate situations.",

Wood wards aren’t awakened lightly, however, as the villagers rarely possess the rituals to return the wards to their slumber.  \n**Implements of Terror.** Unknown to most villages that possess them, wood wards were originally created by evil druids to sow terror in logging villages that were encroaching on the forest. The druids circulated wards around these villages, spreading rumors of their protective capabilities. Most of the druids succumbed to age, heroes, or other forces before getting the chance to enact their schemes, and the villages continued on with wards that did exactly as rumored. Some druid circles still possess the knowledge for awakening the true nature of the wood wards, and stories have surfaced of villages in the darkest depths of the forest going silent, possessing nothing but empty houses and a wall of silent wood wards.  \n**Construct Nature.** A wood ward doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

When yaojing encounter such shysters in their travels, they work tirelessly to bring the charlatans to justice and remove the blight such creatures represent. Yaojing prefer to turn the charlatans over to local authorities for punishment appropriate to the laws of the land they are traveling, but they take on the role of judge when representatives of the law are absent.  \n**Mountain Mystics.** Some yaojing take up a monastic life.

Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source.

They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food.

As creatures unable to sleep or dream, the yumerai consider the ability to dream a gift that all mortals should appreciate. As they travel through mortal dreams, yumerai collect energy from the dreams and use it as a form of currency in fey realms. Fey use dream energy in much the same way mortals use paint, creating seemingly alive portraits or making illusions look, smell, sound, or taste more real.  \n**The Horror of Nightmares.** Yumerai usually look forward to the opportunity to experience new dreams. However, not all dreams are pleasant. Particularly horrifying nightmares may leave permanent mental scars on yumerai who witness them, changing them forever. These yumerai take on a sinister and sometimes sadistic personality, seeking to inflict the pain they felt through the nightmare on those around them.  \n**Dream Walker.** A yumerai doesn’t require sleep.",

This process consumes some of the power of the souls, forcing the zalikum to devour more souls to fuel further rebirths.  \n**Construct Nature.** A zalikum doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

They are “ghosts” of time, flittering from plane to plane, timeline to timeline, unable to anchor themselves with any sort of stability for long.  \n**Fast and Slow.** Warped by time magic, a zeitgeist finds itself alternating between speeding around its foes and being barely able to keep up with them. This alternating is random and outside of the zeitgeist’s control, often pulling it forward in the middle of a conversation or slowing it when attempting to escape an enemy.  \n**Unstable Body and Mind.** The constant instability of being pulled between planes and timelines leaves zeitgeists unable to focus, at best, and deranged, at worst. If a moment of clarity pierces its madness, a zeitgeist might attempt a quick conversation or simply remain motionless, enjoying the temporary reprieve from its tortured existence.  \n**Still Living.** Though named “ghosts,” zeitgeists aren’t dead; rather, something mysterious about their situation sustains them. Similar to a ghost, a zeitgeist might be tied to a particular location, albeit at different points in time. The location might be the site of the magical mishap that created it, a place steeped in planar or time magic, or a place stable enough in time to help the zeitgeist anchor itself and its sanity.  \n**Timewarped Nature.** A zeitgeist doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

If a tail feather is taken without the zouyu’s knowledge, the potion created by the feather bestows bad luck on the drinker for a day. Such bad luck manifests as the drinker tripping over a too-perfectly-placed rock or a lightning strike felling a tree onto the drinker’s path.  \n**Herbivores.** Despite their fangs and sharp claws, zouyu are herbivores.
