Those in positions of power, such as nobles, bureaucrats, rich merchants, and even mercenaries and brigands, all look to either help or hinder you, based on what they think they may get out of it. They're always willing to meet with you briefly to see just how worthwhile such aid or interference might be. This might mean a traveler pays for your passage on a ferry, a generous benefactor covers your group's meals at a tavern, or a local governor invites your adventuring entourage to enjoy a night's stay in their guest quarters. However, the aid often includes an implied threat or request. Some might consider delaying you as long as politely possible, some might consider taking you prisoner for ransom or to do “what's best” for you, and others might decide to help you on your quest in exchange for some future assistance. You're never exactly sure of the associated “cost” of the person's aid until the moment arrives. In the meantime, the open road awaits.",

If you spend 1 hour observing, examining, and exploring your surroundings while in a forest, you are able to identify a safe location to rest. The area is protected from all but the most extreme elements and from the nonmagical native beasts of the forest. In addition, you are able to find sufficient kindling for a small fire throughout the night.\n\n### Life-Changing Event\n\nYou have lived a simple life deep in the sheltering boughs of the forest, be it as a trapper, farmer, or villager eking out a simple existence in the forest. But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that caused you to leave your home for the wider world. \n\n|   d8 | Event                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-----:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    1 | You were living within the forest when cesspools of magical refuse from a nearby city expanded and drove away the game that sustained you.

For inexplicable reasons, the forest took an interest in you. You have faint memories of a village and have had no contact with civilization in many years.                                       |\n|    6 | You were your village's premier hunter. They relied on you for game and without your contributions their survival in the winter was questionable. Upon returning from your last hunt, you found your village in ruins, as if decades had passed overnight. |\n|    7 | Your quiet, peaceful, and solitary existence has been interrupted with dreams of the forest's destruction, and the urge to leave your home compels you to seek answers.                                                                                    |\n|    8 | Once in a hidden glen, you danced with golden fey and forgotten gods.

Use the statistics of an owl for the raptor and the statistics of a jackal for the hunting dog. A hunting companion is trained to obey and respond to a series of one-word commands or signals, communicating basic concepts such as *attack*, *protect*, *retrieve*, *find*, *hide*, or similar. The companion can know up to six such commands and can be trained to obey a number of creatures, other than you, equal to your proficiency bonus. A hunting companion travels with you wherever you go, unless you enter a particularly dangerous environment (such as a poisonous swamp), or you command the companion to stay elsewhere. A hunting companion doesn't join you in combat and stays on the edge of any conflict until it is safe to return to your side. When traveling overland with a hunting companion, you can use the companion to find sufficient food to sustain yourself and up to five other people each day. You can have only one hunting companion at a time.",
