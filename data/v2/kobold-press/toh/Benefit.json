Some might consider delaying you as long as politely possible, some might consider taking you prisoner for ransom or to do “what's best” for you, and others might decide to help you on your quest in exchange for some future assistance.

You keep your own council, and you are more likely to watch from a distance than get involved in the affairs of others. You are wary, slow to trust, and cautious of depending on outsiders.\r\n\r\n| d8 | Personality Trait |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| 1 | I will never forget being hungry in the winter. I field dress beasts that fall to blade or arrow so that I am never hungry again. |\r\n| 2 | I may be alone in the forest, but I am only ever lonely in cities. |\r\n| 3 | Walking barefoot allows me to interact more intuitively with the natural world. |\r\n| 4 | The road is just another kind of wall. I make my own paths and go where I will. |\r\n| 5 | Others seek the gods in temples and shrines, but I know their will is only revealed in the natural world, not an edifice constructed by socalled worshippers. I pray in the woods, never indoors. |\r\n| 6 | What you call personal hygiene, I call an artificially imposed distraction from natural living. |\r\n| 7 | No forged weapon can replace the sheer joy of a kill accomplished only with hands and teeth. |\r\n| 8 | Time lived alone has made me accustomed to talking loudly to myself, something I still do even when others are present. |\r\n\r\n| d6 | Ideal |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| 1 | Change. As the seasons shift, so too does the world around us. To resist is futile and anathema to the natural order. (Chaotic) |\r\n| 2 | Conservation. All life should be preserved and, if needed, protected. (Good) |\r\n| 3 | Acceptance. I am a part of my forest, no different from any other flora and fauna. To think otherwise is arrogance and folly. When I die, it will be as a leaf falling in the woods. (Neutral) |\r\n| 4 | Cull. The weak must be removed for the strong to thrive. (Evil) |\r\n| 5 | Candor. I am open, plain, and simple in life, word, and actions. (Any) |\r\n| 6 | Balance. The forest does not lie. The beasts do not create war. Equity in all things is the way of nature. (Neutral) |\r\n\r\n\r\n| d6 | Bond |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| 1 | When I lose a trusted friend or companion, I plant a tree upon their grave. |\r\n| 2 | The voice of the forest guides me, comforts me, and protects me. |\r\n| 3 | The hermit who raised me and taught me the ways of the forest is the most important person in my life. |\r\n| 4 | I have a wooden doll, a tiny wickerman, that I made as a child and carry with me at all times. |\r\n| 5 | I know the ways of civilizations rise and fall. The forest and the Old Ways are eternal. |\r\n| 6 | I am driven to protect the natural order from those that would disrupt it. |\r\n\r\n\r\n| d6 | Flaw |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| 1 | I am accustomed to doing what I like when I like. I'm bad at compromising, and I must exert real effort to make even basic conversation with other people. |\r\n| 2 | I won't harm a beast without just cause or provocation. |\r\n| 3 | Years of isolated living has left me blind to the nuances of social interaction. It is a struggle not to view every new encounter through the lens of fight or flight. |\r\n| 4 | The decay after death is merely the loam from which new growth springs—and I enjoy nurturing new growth. |\r\n| 5 | An accident that I caused incurred great damage upon my forest, and, as penance, I have placed myself in self-imposed exile. |\r\n| 6 | I distrust the undead and the unliving, and I refuse to work with them. |",

The same is true for all the important things in life. |\n| 5  | Bathing is for novices. I know that to catch my smelly, filthy prey, I must smell like them to throw off their scent.                       |\n| 6  | I eat only raw meat. It gets me more in tune with my prey.                                                                                  |\n| 7  | I'm a connoisseur of killing implements; I only use the best, because I am the best.                                                        |\n| 8  | I thank the natural world for its bounty after every kill.                                                                                  |\n\n| d6 | Ideal                                                                                                                             |\n|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | **Ambition.** It is my divine calling to become better than my rivals by any means necessary. (Chaotic)                               |\n| 2  | **Altruism.** I hunt only to protect those who cannot protect themselves. (Good)                                                      |\n| 3  | **Determination.** No matter what the laws say, I will kill that beast! (Chaotic)                                                     |\n| 4  | **Cruelty.** My prey lives only for my pleasure. It will die exactly as quickly or as slowly as I desire. (Evil)                      |\n| 5  | **Sport.** We're just here to have fun. (Neutral)                                                                                     |\n| 6  | **Family.** I follow in my family's footsteps. I will not tarnish their legacy.

I need to make them proud.                                  |\n| 3  | I was mauled by a beast on my first hunting trip. I've spent my life searching for that monster.                  |\n| 4  | The first time I drew blood, something awoke within me. Every hunt is a search for the original ecstasy of blood. |\n| 5  | My hunting companions used to laugh at me behind my back. They aren't laughing anymore.                           |\n| 6  | A close friend funded my first hunting expedition.
