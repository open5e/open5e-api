You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls with this magic weapon. In addition to the normal effects of a net, this net prevents any Large or smaller aberration, celestial, or fiend hit by it from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. When such a creature is bound in this way, a creature must succeed on a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check to free the bound creature. The net has immunity to damage dealt by the bound creature, but another creature can deal 20 slashing damage to the net and free the bound creature, ending the effect. The net has AC 15 and 30 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the net drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.",
