            "desc": "Crafted to serve in place of the dead in the afterlife, shabti are often used by the living for their own ends. These 1-foot-tall statuettes are crafted of ceramic, stone, or terracotta and are garbed in gear indicative of their function. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the shabti to a point on the ground within 30 feet of you, it grows into a Medium construct that performs the tasks for which it was created. If the space where the shabti would grow is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the shabti, the shabti doesn’t grow. Unless stated otherwise in an individual shabti’s description, a servile shabti uses the statistics of animated armor, except the servile shabti’s Armor Class is 13, and it doesn’t have the Multiattack or Slam actions. When the shabti is motionless, it is indistinguishable from a ceramic, stone, or terracotta statue, rather than a suit of armor. The shabti is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts immediately after you. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands (no action required by you unless specified in the shabti’s description). If you issue no commands, the shabti takes the Dodge action and no other actions. The shabti exists for a duration specific to each shabti. At the end of the duration, it reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a statuette early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the shabti becomes a statuette again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the shabti’s description. Crafter Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti wears a leather apron and carries the tools of its trade. Each crafting shabti is skilled in a single craft— weaponsmithing, pottery, carpentry, or another trade—and has proficiency with the appropriate artisan’s tools. You can use an action to command the shabti to craft a single, nonmagical item within its skill set, so long as you provide it the raw materials to do so. The shabti works at incredible speeds, needing only 10 minutes per 100 gp value of the item to finish its task. A crafting shabti can never create magic items. Once it completes its task, the shabti reverts to statuette form, and it can’t be used again until a number of hours have passed equal to twice the market value in gold pieces of the item crafted (minimum of 10 hours). Defender Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. You can use a bonus action to command the shabti to either defend you or harass an enemy you can see within 30 feet of you. If the shabti defends you, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has disadvantage on melee weapon attack rolls against you. If the shabti harasses a creature, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls against that creature. The shabti remains active for up to 8 hours, after which it reverts to statuette form and can’t be used again until 3 days have passed. Digger Shabti (Uncommon). The shabti carries a shovel and pick. You can command the shabti to excavate earthworks to your specifications. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of earth or mud in any fashion (digging a hole or trench, raising a rampart, or similar), which takes 1 minute to complete. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of stone in a similar fashion, but it takes 10 minutes to complete. The shabti can work for up to 1 hour before reverting to statuette form. Once used, the shabti can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. Farmer Shabti (Rare). This shabti carries farming implements. If you activate it in an area with sufficient soil and a climate suitable for growing crops, the shabti begins tilling the earth and planting seeds it carries, which are magically replenished during its time in statuette form. The shabti tends its field, magically bringing the crops to full growth and harvesting them in a period of 8 hours. The yield from the harvest is enough to feed up to twelve creatures for 7 days, and the crops remain edible for 30 days before perishing. Alternately, the shabti can spend 10 minutes planting magical crops. The magical crops take 30 minutes to grow and harvest and 30 minutes to consume. Up to twelve creatures can consume the magical crops, gaining benefits as if partaking in a heroes' feast. The benefits don’t set in until 30 minutes after the crops were harvested, and any uneaten crops disappear at that time. Once the shabti is used to perform either function, the shabti returns to statuette form, and it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed. Healer Shabti (Very Rare). This shabti is dressed in scholarly robes and carries a bag of medical supplies. It is proficient with a healer’s kit, has Medicine +7, and tends to the wounds of you and your companions. If directed to administer care when you take a short rest, the shabti can tend the wounds of up to six creatures over the course of the hour. Each creature that spends Hit Dice to regain hit points during that short rest increases the amount gained per Hit Die by 2, up to the maximum number that can be rolled. The shabti follows you and tends to the wounds of you and your companions, as directed, for up to 8 hours before reverting to statuette form. While the shabti is active, you can use a bonus action to command it to cast cure wounds (4th-level version), lesser restoration, or protection from poison on one creature you can see within 30 feet of you on its next turn. The shabti can cast each spell only once. When it has cast all three spells, the shabti reverts to statuette form, even if its normal duration hasn’t ended. Once the shabti has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed. Warrior Shabti (Rare). This shabti wields a spear and carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. This shabti has the animated armor’s Multiattack and Slam actions, except the shabti’s Slam attack deals piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for the animated armor’s Slam attack. This shabti can understand and carry out fairly complex commands, such as standing watch while you and your companions rest or guarding a room and letting only specific creatures in or out. The shabti follows you and acts as directed for up to 8 hours or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it returns to statuette form. Once the shabti has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.",

Unless stated otherwise in an individual shabti’s description, a servile shabti uses the statistics of animated armor, except the servile shabti’s Armor Class is 13, and it doesn’t have the Multiattack or Slam actions. When the shabti is motionless, it is indistinguishable from a ceramic, stone, or terracotta statue, rather than a suit of armor. The shabti is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts immediately after you. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands (no action required by you unless specified in the shabti’s description). If you issue no commands, the shabti takes the Dodge action and no other actions. The shabti exists for a duration specific to each shabti. At the end of the duration, it reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a statuette early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the shabti becomes a statuette again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the shabti’s description. Crafter Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti wears a leather apron and carries the tools of its trade. Each crafting shabti is skilled in a single craft— weaponsmithing, pottery, carpentry, or another trade—and has proficiency with the appropriate artisan’s tools. You can use an action to command the shabti to craft a single, nonmagical item within its skill set, so long as you provide it the raw materials to do so. The shabti works at incredible speeds, needing only 10 minutes per 100 gp value of the item to finish its task. A crafting shabti can never create magic items. Once it completes its task, the shabti reverts to statuette form, and it can’t be used again until a number of hours have passed equal to twice the market value in gold pieces of the item crafted (minimum of 10 hours). Defender Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. You can use a bonus action to command the shabti to either defend you or harass an enemy you can see within 30 feet of you. If the shabti defends you, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has disadvantage on melee weapon attack rolls against you. If the shabti harasses a creature, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls against that creature. The shabti remains active for up to 8 hours, after which it reverts to statuette form and can’t be used again until 3 days have passed. Digger Shabti (Uncommon). The shabti carries a shovel and pick. You can command the shabti to excavate earthworks to your specifications. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of earth or mud in any fashion (digging a hole or trench, raising a rampart, or similar), which takes 1 minute to complete. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of stone in a similar fashion, but it takes 10 minutes to complete. The shabti can work for up to 1 hour before reverting to statuette form. Once used, the shabti can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. Farmer Shabti (Rare). This shabti carries farming implements. If you activate it in an area with sufficient soil and a climate suitable for growing crops, the shabti begins tilling the earth and planting seeds it carries, which are magically replenished during its time in statuette form. The shabti tends its field, magically bringing the crops to full growth and harvesting them in a period of 8 hours. The yield from the harvest is enough to feed up to twelve creatures for 7 days, and the crops remain edible for 30 days before perishing. Alternately, the shabti can spend 10 minutes planting magical crops. The magical crops take 30 minutes to grow and harvest and 30 minutes to consume. Up to twelve creatures can consume the magical crops, gaining benefits as if partaking in a heroes' feast. The benefits don’t set in until 30 minutes after the crops were harvested, and any uneaten crops disappear at that time. Once the shabti is used to perform either function, the shabti returns to statuette form, and it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed. Healer Shabti (Very Rare). This shabti is dressed in scholarly robes and carries a bag of medical supplies. It is proficient with a healer’s kit, has Medicine +7, and tends to the wounds of you and your companions. If directed to administer care when you take a short rest, the shabti can tend the wounds of up to six creatures over the course of the hour. Each creature that spends Hit Dice to regain hit points during that short rest increases the amount gained per Hit Die by 2, up to the maximum number that can be rolled. The shabti follows you and tends to the wounds of you and your companions, as directed, for up to 8 hours before reverting to statuette form. While the shabti is active, you can use a bonus action to command it to cast cure wounds (4th-level version), lesser restoration, or protection from poison on one creature you can see within 30 feet of you on its next turn. The shabti can cast each spell only once. When it has cast all three spells, the shabti reverts to statuette form, even if its normal duration hasn’t ended. Once the shabti has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed. Warrior Shabti (Rare). This shabti wields a spear and carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. This shabti has the animated armor’s Multiattack and Slam actions, except the shabti’s Slam attack deals piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for the animated armor’s Slam attack. This shabti can understand and carry out fairly complex commands, such as standing watch while you and your companions rest or guarding a room and letting only specific creatures in or out. The shabti follows you and acts as directed for up to 8 hours or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it returns to statuette form. Once the shabti has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.",
