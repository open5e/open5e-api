    "name": "Aberrant Agreement",
    "desc": "This long scroll bears strange runes and seals of eldritch powers. When you use an action to present this scroll to an aberration whose Challenge Rating is equal to or less than your level, the binding powers of the scroll compel it to listen to you. You can then attempt to strike a bargain with the aberration, negotiating a service from it in exchange for a reward. The aberration is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the aberration, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the aberration refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the aberration reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the agreement and have the aberration do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the aberration to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll blackens and crumbles to dust. An aberration's thinking is alien to most humanoids, and vaguely worded contracts may result in unintended consequences, as the creature may have different thoughts as to how to best meet the goal. If either party breaks the bargain, that creature immediately takes 10d6 psychic damage, and the charter is destroyed, ending the contract.",

Each target must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. If a target dies from this damage or while frightened, the otherworldly spirits within the idol are temporarily sated, and you don't suffer the effects of the idol's Otherworldly Whispers property at the next dusk. Once used, this property of the idol can't be used again until the next dusk.\n- You can use an action to cast the augury spell from the idol.

    "desc": "This large alembic is a glass retort supported by a bronze tripod and connected to a smaller glass container by a bronze spout. The bronze fittings are etched with arcane symbols, and the glass parts of the alembic sometimes emit bright, amethyst sparks. If a magic item is placed inside the alembic and a fire lit beneath it, the magic item dissolves and its magical energy drains into the smaller container. Artifacts, legendary magic items, and any magic item that won't physically fit into the alembic (anything larger than a shortsword or a cloak) can't be dissolved in this way. Full dissolution and distillation of an item's magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10 minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical. If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic, its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle and easy to incorporate into new magic items. Using arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost of the new item by 10 percent per degree of rarity of the magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm. An alembic of unmaking can distill or disenchant one item per 24 hours.",

At the end of the week, the animal companion or familiar exits the bag as a bramble creature (see the template in the sidebar) and can be returned to its original form only with a wish. The creature retains its status as an animal companion or familiar after its transformation and can choose to activate or deactivate its Thorn Body trait as a bonus action. A transformed familiar can be re-summoned with the find familiar spell. Once the bag has been used to change an animal companion or familiar into a bramble creature, it becomes an ordinary, nonmagical bag. | 1d8 | Creature |\n| --- | ------------ |\n| 1 | Weasel |\n| 2 | Giant rat |\n| 3 | Badger |\n| 4 | Boar |\n| 5 | Panther |\n| 6 | Giant badger | Only a beast can become a bramble creature.

When you consume a dose, your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are reduced by 1 each. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. You can consume up to three doses as part of casting a spell, and you can choose to affect your spell with one of the following options for each dose you consumed: - If the spell is of the abjuration school, increase the save DC by 2.\n- If the spell has more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, treat the spell's effects as if you had cast the spell at one slot level higher than the spell slot you used.\n- The spell is affected by one of the following metamagic options, even if you aren't a sorcerer: heightened, quickened, or subtle. A spell can't be affected by the same option more than once, though you can affect one spell with up to three different options. If you consume one or more doses without casting a spell, you can choose to instead affect a spell you cast before you finish a long rest.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to the number of doses you consumed. At the end of each long rest, you must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, your Hit Dice maximum is reduced by 25 percent. This reduction affects only the number of Hit Dice you can use to regain hit points during a short rest; it doesn't reduce your hit point maximum. This reduction lasts until you recover from the addiction. If you have no remaining Hit Dice to lose, you suffer one level of exhaustion, and your Hit Dice are returned to 75 percent of your maximum Hit Dice. The process then repeats until you die from exhaustion or you recover from the addiction. On a successful save, your exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces your level of exhaustion below 1, you recover from the addiction. A greater restoration spell or similar magic ends the addiction and its effects. Consuming at least one dose of blue rose again halts the effects of the addiction for 2 days, at which point you can consume another dose of blue rose to halt it again or the effects of the addiction continue as normal.",

Its covers often reflect light as if it were resting in a forest grove, and some owners swear that a goblin face appears on them now and again. The sturdy lock on one side opens only for wizards, elves, and Shadow Fey (see Tome of Beasts). The book has 15 charges, and it regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily in the twilight before dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the book retains its Ebon Tides and Shadow Lore properties but loses its Spells property. When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the Terrain Changes table for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected; built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an Overshadow (see Tome of Beasts 2) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options. Deities, Fey Lords and Ladies (see Tome of Beasts), archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Plane of Shadow can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains.

This bugbear necromancer was once the henchman of an accomplished practitioner of the dark arts named Varrus. She started as a bodyguard and tough, but her keen intellect caught her master's attention. He eventually took her on as an apprentice. Moxug is fascinated with fear, and some say she doesn't eat but instead sustains herself on the terror of her victims. She eventually betrayed Varrus, sabotaging his attempt to become a lich, and luxuriated in his fear as he realized he would die rather than achieve immortality. According to rumor, the first craven's heart she crafted came from the body of her former master.",

Once the left eye of an ornate and magical statue of a pit fiend revered by a small cult of Mammon, this exquisite purple gem was pried from the idol by an adventurer named Slick Finnigan. Slick and his companions had taken it upon themselves to eradicate the cult, eager for the accolades they would receive for defeating an evil in the community. The loot they stood to gain didn't hurt either. After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind. This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol.

    "name": "Figurehead of Prowess",
    "desc": "A figurehead of prowess must be mounted on the bow of a ship for its magic to take effect. While mounted on a ship, the figurehead’s magic affects the ship and every creature on the ship. A figurehead can be mounted on any ship larger than a rowboat, regardless if that ship sails the sea, the sky, rivers and lakes, or the sands of the desert. A ship can have only one figurehead mounted on it at a time. Most figureheads are always active, but some have properties that must be activated. To activate a figurehead’s special property, a creature must be at the helm of the ship, referred to below as the “pilot,” and must use an action to speak the figurehead’s command word. \nAlbatross (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s pilot can double its proficiency bonus with navigator’s tools when navigating the ship. In addition, the ship’s pilot doesn’t have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when peering through fog, rain, dust storms, or other natural phenomena that would ordinarily lightly obscure the pilot’s vision. \nBasilisk (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s AC increases by 2. \nDragon Turtle (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to fire damage, and the ship’s damage threshold increases by 5. If the ship doesn’t normally have a damage threshold, it gains a damage threshold of 5. \nKraken (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can animate all of the ship’s ropes. If a creature on the ship uses an animated rope while taking the grapple action, the creature has advantage on the check. Alternatively, the pilot can command the ropes to move as if being moved by a crew, allowing a ship to dock or a sailing ship to sail without a crew. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action. When the ship’s ropes have been animated for a total of 10 minutes, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nManta Ray (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s speed increases by half. For example, a ship with a speed of 4 miles per hour would have a speed of 6 miles per hour while this figurehead was mounted on it. \nNarwhal (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to cold damage, and the ship can break through ice sheets without taking damage or needing to make a check. \nOctopus (Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on ships designed for water travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to dive beneath the water. The ship moves at its normal speed while underwater, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour underwater, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nSphinx (Legendary). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship that isn’t designed for air travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can command the ship to rise into the air. The ship moves at its normal speed while in the air, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to descend at a rate of 60 feet per round until it reaches land or water. When the ship has spent a total of 8 hours in the sky, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nXorn (Very Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship designed for land travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to burrow into the earth. The ship moves at its normal speed while burrowing, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. The ship can burrow through nonmagical, unworked sand, mud, earth, and stone, and it doesn’t disturb the material it moves through. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour burrowing, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn.",

It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges. While in bull form, it is considered to be a Huge creature for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity, and nonmagical difficult terrain doesn’t cost it extra movement. \nLapis Camel (Rare).

Beasts with an Intelligence of 3 or lower don’t willingly board a vessel where this flag flies. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check convinces an unwilling beast to board the vessel, though it remains uneasy and skittish while aboard. \nCursed Crew. When this baleful flag flies atop the mast of a waterborne vehicle, it curses the vessel and all those that board it. When a creature that isn’t a humanoid dies aboard the vessel, it rises 1 minute later as a zombie under the ship captain’s control. When a humanoid dies aboard the vessel, it rises 1 minute later as a ghoul under the ship captain’s control. A ghoul retains any knowledge of sailing or maintaining a waterborne vehicle that it had in life. \nCursed Captain. If the ship flying this flag doesn’t have a captain, the undead crew seeks out a powerful humanoid or intelligent undead to bring aboard and coerce into becoming the captain. When an undead with an Intelligence of 10 or higher boards the captainless vehicle, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become magically bound to the ship and the flag. If the creature exits the vessel and boards it again, the creature must repeat the saving throw. The flag fills the captain with the desire to attack other vessels to grow its crew and commandeer larger vessels when possible, bringing the flag with it. If the flag is destroyed or removed from a waterborne vehicle for at least 7 days, the zombie and ghoul crew crumbles to dust, and the captain is freed of the flag’s magic, if the captain was bound to it. \nUnholy Vessel. While aboard a vessel flying this flag, an undead creature has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead, and if it fails the saving throw, it isn’t destroyed, no matter its CR. In addition, the captain and crew can’t be frightened while aboard a vessel flying this flag. \nWhen a creature that isn’t a construct or undead and isn’t part of the crew boards the vessel, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned while it remains on board.

    "desc": "This belt quiver is wide enough to pass a rolled scroll through the opening. Containing an extra dimensional space, the quiver can hold up to 25 scrolls and weighs 1 pound, regardless of its contents. Placing a scroll in the quiver follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving a scroll from the quiver requires you to use an action. When you reach into the quiver for a specific scroll, that scroll is always magically on top. The quiver has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the quiver ruptures and is destroyed. If the quiver is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If a breathing creature is placed within the quiver, the creature can survive for up to 5 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing the quiver inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

The firework sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the firework’s bright light.\n Priest Light (Rare). This silver cylinder firework produces a tall, argent flame and numerous golden sparks for 10 minutes. The flame appears on the round after you throw it. The firework sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. An undead creature can’t willingly enter the firework’s bright light by nonmagical means. If the undead creature tries to use teleportation or similar interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If an undead creature is in the bright light when it appears, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to leave the bright light. It won’t move into any obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move out of the bright light. In addition, each non-undead creature in the bright light can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by an undead creature.\n Red Dragon’s Breath (Very Rare). This firework is wrapped in gold leaf and inscribed with scarlet runes, and it erupts into a vertical column of fire on impact. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on the point of impact must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n Snake Fountain (Rare). This short, wide cylinder is red, yellow, and black with a scale motif, and it produces snakes made of ash for 1 minute. It starts producing snakes on the round after you throw it. The firework creates 1 poisonous snake each round. The snakes are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the snakes as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The snakes remain for 10 minutes, until you dismiss them as a bonus action, or until they are doused with at least 1 gallon of water.",

Each manual of the lesser golem describes the materials needed and the process to be followed to create one type of lesser golem. The GM chooses the type of lesser golem detailed in the manual or determines the golem type randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least one 2nd-level spell slot. You must also succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check at the start of the first day of golem creation. If you fail the check, you must wait at least 24 hours to restart the creation process, and you take 3d6 psychic damage that can be regained only after a long rest. A lesser golem created via a manual of the lesser golem is not immortal. The magic that keeps the lesser golem intact gradually weakens until the golem finally falls apart. A lesser golem lasts exactly twice the number of days it takes to create it (see below) before losing its power. Once the golem is created, the manual is expended, the writing worthless and incapable of creating another. The statistics for each lesser golem can be found in the Creature Codex. | dice: 1d20 | Golem | Time | Cost |\n| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------- | --------- |\n| 1-7 | Lesser Hair Golem | 2 days | 100 gp |\n| 8-13 | Lesser Mud Golem | 5 days | 500 gp |\n| 14-17 | Lesser Glass Golem | 10 days | 2,000 gp |\n| 18-20 | Lesser Wood Golem | 15 days | 20,000 gp |",

    "desc": "This pole is crafted to exact retribution for an act of cowardice or dishonor. It's a sturdy wooden stave, 6 to 10 feet long, carved with runes that name the dishonored target of the pole's curse. The carved shaft is draped in horsehide, topped with a horse's skull, and placed where its target is expected to pass by. Typically, the pole is driven into the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot where the intended victim won't see it until it's too late. The pole is created to punish a specific person for a specific crime. The exact target must be named on the pole; a generic identity such as \u201cthe person who blinded Lars Gustafson\u201d isn't precise enough. The moment the named target approaches within 333 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with a range of 333 feet instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target's Wisdom saving throw is 15. If the saving throw is successful, the pole recasts the spell at the end of each round until the saving throw fails, the target retreats out of range, or the pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole's creator who tries to destroy or knock down the pole is also targeted by a bestow curse spell, but only once. The effect of the curse is set when the pole is created, and the curse lasts 8 hours without requiring concentration. The pole becomes nonmagical once it has laid its curse on its intended target. An untriggered and forgotten nithing pole remains dangerous for centuries.",

Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed.

    "name": "Servile Shabti",
    "desc": "Crafted to serve in place of the dead in the afterlife, shabti are often used by the living for their own ends. These 1-foot-tall statuettes are crafted of ceramic, stone, or terracotta and are garbed in gear indicative of their function. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the shabti to a point on the ground within 30 feet of you, it grows into a Medium construct that performs the tasks for which it was created. If the space where the shabti would grow is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the shabti, the shabti doesn’t grow. Unless stated otherwise in an individual shabti’s description, a servile shabti uses the statistics of animated armor, except the servile shabti’s Armor Class is 13, and it doesn’t have the Multiattack or Slam actions. When the shabti is motionless, it is indistinguishable from a ceramic, stone, or terracotta statue, rather than a suit of armor. The shabti is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts immediately after you. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands (no action required by you unless specified in the shabti’s description). If you issue no commands, the shabti takes the Dodge action and no other actions. The shabti exists for a duration specific to each shabti. At the end of the duration, it reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a statuette early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the shabti becomes a statuette again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the shabti’s description. Crafter Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti wears a leather apron and carries the tools of its trade. Each crafting shabti is skilled in a single craft— weaponsmithing, pottery, carpentry, or another trade—and has proficiency with the appropriate artisan’s tools. You can use an action to command the shabti to craft a single, nonmagical item within its skill set, so long as you provide it the raw materials to do so. The shabti works at incredible speeds, needing only 10 minutes per 100 gp value of the item to finish its task. A crafting shabti can never create magic items. Once it completes its task, the shabti reverts to statuette form, and it can’t be used again until a number of hours have passed equal to twice the market value in gold pieces of the item crafted (minimum of 10 hours). Defender Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. You can use a bonus action to command the shabti to either defend you or harass an enemy you can see within 30 feet of you. If the shabti defends you, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has disadvantage on melee weapon attack rolls against you. If the shabti harasses a creature, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls against that creature. The shabti remains active for up to 8 hours, after which it reverts to statuette form and can’t be used again until 3 days have passed. Digger Shabti (Uncommon). The shabti carries a shovel and pick. You can command the shabti to excavate earthworks to your specifications. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of earth or mud in any fashion (digging a hole or trench, raising a rampart, or similar), which takes 1 minute to complete. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of stone in a similar fashion, but it takes 10 minutes to complete. The shabti can work for up to 1 hour before reverting to statuette form. Once used, the shabti can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. Farmer Shabti (Rare). This shabti carries farming implements. If you activate it in an area with sufficient soil and a climate suitable for growing crops, the shabti begins tilling the earth and planting seeds it carries, which are magically replenished during its time in statuette form. The shabti tends its field, magically bringing the crops to full growth and harvesting them in a period of 8 hours. The yield from the harvest is enough to feed up to twelve creatures for 7 days, and the crops remain edible for 30 days before perishing. Alternately, the shabti can spend 10 minutes planting magical crops. The magical crops take 30 minutes to grow and harvest and 30 minutes to consume. Up to twelve creatures can consume the magical crops, gaining benefits as if partaking in a heroes' feast. The benefits don’t set in until 30 minutes after the crops were harvested, and any uneaten crops disappear at that time. Once the shabti is used to perform either function, the shabti returns to statuette form, and it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed. Healer Shabti (Very Rare). This shabti is dressed in scholarly robes and carries a bag of medical supplies. It is proficient with a healer’s kit, has Medicine +7, and tends to the wounds of you and your companions. If directed to administer care when you take a short rest, the shabti can tend the wounds of up to six creatures over the course of the hour. Each creature that spends Hit Dice to regain hit points during that short rest increases the amount gained per Hit Die by 2, up to the maximum number that can be rolled. The shabti follows you and tends to the wounds of you and your companions, as directed, for up to 8 hours before reverting to statuette form. While the shabti is active, you can use a bonus action to command it to cast cure wounds (4th-level version), lesser restoration, or protection from poison on one creature you can see within 30 feet of you on its next turn. The shabti can cast each spell only once. When it has cast all three spells, the shabti reverts to statuette form, even if its normal duration hasn’t ended. Once the shabti has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed. Warrior Shabti (Rare). This shabti wields a spear and carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. This shabti has the animated armor’s Multiattack and Slam actions, except the shabti’s Slam attack deals piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for the animated armor’s Slam attack. This shabti can understand and carry out fairly complex commands, such as standing watch while you and your companions rest or guarding a room and letting only specific creatures in or out. The shabti follows you and acts as directed for up to 8 hours or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it returns to statuette form. Once the shabti has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.",

While wearing this amulet, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word and expend 1 of its charges to create a brief magical bond with a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically bonded with you until the end of your next turn. While bonded in this way, you can choose to have advantage on attack rolls against the target or cause the target to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.",

    "name": "Zipline Ring",
    "desc": "This plain gold ring features a magnificent ruby. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to cause a crimson zipline of magical force to extend from the gem in the ring and attach to up to two solid surfaces you can see. Each surface must be within 150 feet of you. Once the zipline is connected, you can use a bonus action to magically travel up to 50 feet along the line between the two surfaces. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. While the zipline is active, you remain suspended within 5 feet of the line, floating off the ground at least 3 inches, and you can't move more than 5 feet away from the zipline. When you magically travel along the line, you don't provoke opportunity attacks. The hand wearing the ring must be pointed at the line when you magically travel along it, but you otherwise can act normally while the zipline is active. You can use a bonus action to end the zipline. When the zipline has been active for a total of 1 minute, the ring's magic ceases to function until the next dawn.",
